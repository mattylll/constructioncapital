          "Legal due diligence is the process by which a lender's solicitor investigates the legal title, planning status, and regulatory compliance of a development site before funds are released. In our experience arranging <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> facilities across the UK, this is the stage that most frequently causes delays, yet it is also the stage that developers are least prepared for. Understanding what solicitors check and why they check it gives you a significant advantage when structuring your deal.",
          "The lender's solicitor acts as the lender's gatekeeper. Their job is to ensure that the security the lender is taking, typically a first legal charge over the development site, is valid, enforceable, and free from defects that could impair its value. This means investigating everything from the paper trail of ownership to the environmental history of the land. For a typical development finance facility of £1,500,000 to £5,000,000, legal fees for the lender's solicitor alone can range from £5,000 to £15,000, so the process is thorough.",
          "We have seen transactions where the developer assumed legal due diligence was a formality, only to discover title defects, missing planning conditions, or unregistered rights that added weeks or even months to the completion timeline. The developers who move fastest through this process are those who instruct their own solicitor early, commission searches upfront, and prepare a comprehensive legal pack before the lender's solicitor is even instructed."

          "The first thing the lender's solicitor examines is the legal title to the property. They obtain official copies of the title register and title plan from the Land Registry to confirm that the borrower, or the borrower's SPV, is the registered owner or has an enforceable contract to acquire the site. If you are purchasing the site simultaneously with the drawdown of your <a href=\"/guides/how-does-development-finance-work\">development finance</a>, the solicitor will review the acquisition contract to ensure it is unconditional and that the purchase price aligns with the lender's valuation.",
          "Title investigation goes far beyond confirming ownership. The solicitor will review every entry on the charges register to identify existing mortgages, charges, or restrictions that need to be discharged or subordinated before the lender can take a first legal charge. They examine the property register for any restrictive covenants, easements, or rights of way that could affect the proposed development. A restrictive covenant preventing construction above two storeys, for example, would be a fundamental issue for a three-storey apartment scheme.",
          "In our experience, the most common title issues that delay development finance completions include unregistered land, where the title has never been registered at the Land Registry and requires first registration; defective title chains, where historic transfers were not properly executed; and discrepancies between the title plan boundary and the physical site boundary. Each of these issues is resolvable, but resolution takes time. We always advise developers to obtain official copies of their title and review them with their solicitor before submitting a finance application, so that any issues can be addressed in parallel with the lender's credit process."

This means checking that the planning consent matches the scheme described in the development appraisal and that no conditions remain outstanding that would prevent the commencement of works. Pre-commencement conditions are particularly important because starting work without discharging them can invalidate the entire planning permission, a risk no lender is willing to accept.",
          "Common pre-commencement conditions include the submission and approval of a construction management plan, archaeological investigation, contamination remediation strategy, drainage scheme, and details of external materials. Each condition requires formal discharge by the local planning authority, which can take eight to twelve weeks. We have arranged facilities where the developer had full planning permission but had not discharged a single pre-commencement condition, adding three months to the project timeline before the first brick could be laid.",
          "The solicitor also checks the planning permission for any Section 106 obligations or Community Infrastructure Levy liabilities. A <a href=\"/guides/cil-section-106-obligations\">CIL liability</a> of £150,000 on a residential scheme in Greater London needs to be factored into both the development appraisal and the cash flow. If these obligations have not been properly accounted for, the lender may adjust the facility amount or require additional equity from the developer.",
          "For schemes relying on <a href=\"/guides/permitted-development-rights-finance\">permitted development rights</a> rather than full planning permission, the solicitor will verify that the prior approval is valid and that the proposed use falls within the relevant class order. This is a highly technical area where errors are common and the consequences severe."

          "A standard suite of property searches is commissioned as part of legal due diligence. These include local authority searches, environmental searches, water and drainage searches, mining searches where applicable, and chancel repair liability searches. The cost of a full search pack typically ranges from £300 to £800 depending on the location and the number of specialist searches required.",
          "Environmental searches are increasingly important in <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> transactions. The environmental search report identifies potential contamination risks based on the historical use of the site and surrounding land. A site with a former industrial use, fuel storage, or proximity to a landfill will flag on the environmental search and may require a Phase 1 desk study or even a Phase 2 intrusive investigation before the lender will proceed. We have seen environmental remediation costs range from £20,000 for minor contamination to over £500,000 for heavily contaminated brownfield sites.",
          "The local authority search reveals a wealth of information including road schemes, conservation area status, tree preservation orders, smoke control zones, and any outstanding enforcement notices. The water and drainage search confirms whether the site is connected to mains water and sewerage, and whether any public sewers cross the site that would restrict the building footprint. These are not merely bureaucratic exercises. A public sewer running beneath your proposed building footprint can require a build-over agreement from the water authority or, in the worst case, redesign of the scheme to avoid the sewer entirely."

The borrower's solicitor must review these carefully. The <a href=\"/guides/development-finance-facility-agreement\">facility agreement</a> sets out every term of the loan including the interest rate, drawdown mechanics, financial covenants, representations and warranties, events of default, and the conditions precedent that must be satisfied before the first drawdown.",
          "The security package typically includes a first legal charge over the development site, a debenture over the borrower company's assets if the borrower is a limited company or SPV, personal guarantees from the directors, and an assignment of the building contract, professional team appointments, and insurance policies. Each document requires careful review to ensure that the terms are commercially acceptable and that the developer understands their obligations. In our experience, developers who skip the detailed review of their facility agreement are the ones most likely to encounter problems during the build, particularly around drawdown conditions and default triggers.",
          "We always recommend that developers engage a solicitor with specific experience in development finance transactions. A residential conveyancer or general commercial solicitor may not be familiar with the nuances of drawdown mechanics, monitoring surveyor provisions, or the implications of specific financial covenants. The cost of instructing a specialist is typically £3,000 to £8,000 for the borrower's legal fees, but this investment can prevent far more expensive problems later.

        heading: "Common due diligence pitfalls and how to avoid them",
        content: [
          "The most frequent pitfall we encounter is developers treating legal due diligence as an afterthought. They focus on the commercial terms of the loan, the interest rate and the LTV, and assume the legal process will take care of itself. In practice, legal due diligence is the critical path in most development finance transactions. A deal that receives credit approval in two weeks can easily take another six to eight weeks to complete if the legal pack is not properly prepared.",
          "Missing or incomplete documentation is another common issue. The lender's solicitor will require certified copies of all planning permissions and decision notices, discharge of condition notices, building regulation approvals, party wall awards, the building contract, professional appointments for architect, structural engineer and other consultants, and evidence of insurance. Gathering these documents takes time, and every missing document adds to the completion timeline. We advise developers to compile a digital legal pack from the very start of the project and keep it updated as new documents are produced.",
          "Finally, developers sometimes instruct the cheapest solicitor they can find, only to discover that the solicitor is unfamiliar with development finance transactions and cannot respond efficiently to the lender's solicitor's enquiries. This false economy can cost thousands of pounds in delayed drawdowns and extended interest accrual. In our experience, the best outcomes are achieved when both solicitors are experienced in development finance and can communicate in the same professional language, resolving issues quickly and keeping the transaction on track."

        content: [
          "A development finance facility agreement is the legally binding contract between the borrower and the lender that governs the entire loan. It sets out the amount of the facility, the interest rate, the drawdown schedule, the conditions under which funds will be released, the representations and warranties given by the borrower, the financial covenants that must be maintained, and the events that will trigger a default. In our experience arranging <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> for projects ranging from £500,000 to £25,000,000, the facility agreement is the document that determines the success or failure of the borrower-lender relationship.",
          "Unlike a standard mortgage offer, which is relatively straightforward, a development finance facility agreement is a complex commercial lending document that can run to sixty or more pages. Every clause has been drafted to protect the lender's position, and while many terms are non-negotiable, there are areas where an experienced borrower's solicitor can achieve more favourable terms. The key is understanding which clauses are standard market practice and which represent the lender taking an aggressive position that warrants pushback.",
          "We strongly recommend that every developer reads and understands their facility agreement before signing it. Too many developers sign without fully appreciating the implications of specific clauses, particularly around drawdown conditions, cost overrun provisions, and default triggers. Ignorance of the terms is not a defence when things go wrong on site."

        heading: "Drawdown conditions and mechanics",
        content: [
          "The drawdown provisions are the operational heart of the facility agreement. They specify the conditions that must be satisfied before each tranche of the loan is released. These conditions typically fall into two categories: conditions precedent to the initial drawdown, which must be satisfied before any funds are released, and conditions precedent to subsequent drawdowns, which must be satisfied before each construction tranche.",
          "Conditions precedent to the initial drawdown usually include satisfactory completion of <a href=\"/guides/legal-due-diligence-development-finance\">legal due diligence</a>, receipt of a satisfactory valuation, evidence that all planning conditions have been discharged, execution of the building contract, evidence of all required insurances, and confirmation that any required equity contribution has been made. For a typical £2,000,000 facility, the borrower might need to demonstrate that they have invested £400,000 of equity before the lender advances any funds.",
          "Subsequent drawdown conditions typically require a satisfactory monitoring surveyor report confirming that works have progressed to the stage claimed in the drawdown request, that costs remain within budget, and that there are no material defects. The facility agreement will specify the minimum notice period for drawdown requests, usually five to ten working days, and may limit the frequency of drawdowns to monthly intervals. Understanding these mechanics is essential for cash flow planning. A developer who expects to draw funds weekly will be disappointed to discover that the facility agreement limits drawdowns to monthly tranches with ten working days notice.",
          "We have seen developers run into serious cash flow problems because they did not understand the drawdown mechanics in their facility agreement. If your contractor requires weekly payments but you can only draw from the lender monthly, you need working capital to bridge the gap. This is a point we always raise when <a href=\"/deal-room\">structuring deals</a> for our clients."

        heading: "Financial covenants and reporting obligations",
        content: [
          "Financial covenants in a development finance facility agreement are ongoing obligations that the borrower must maintain throughout the life of the loan. The most common covenant is a loan-to-value ratio, expressed either as a percentage of current market value or as a percentage of gross development value. If the covenant requires that the loan does not exceed 65% of GDV and sales values fall during the build, the borrower may find themselves in breach and required to inject additional equity or face a default.",
          "Other financial covenants may include a minimum profit margin covenant, typically requiring that the projected profit on GDV does not fall below 15-20%, and a cost overrun covenant requiring the borrower to fund any cost overruns from their own resources before additional lending is made available. Some lenders also impose a minimum net worth covenant on the borrower or its guarantors, requiring them to maintain personal net assets above a specified level throughout the loan term.",
          "Reporting obligations accompany these covenants. The facility agreement will typically require the borrower to provide monthly progress reports, updated cost schedules, sales or marketing reports, copies of all monitoring surveyor reports, and notification of any material adverse change to the project. Failure to comply with reporting obligations can itself constitute an event of default, even if the project is progressing well. We always advise developers to diarise their reporting deadlines and treat them with the same importance as drawdown requests. A lender who receives timely, comprehensive reports is far more likely to be supportive if issues arise later in the build."

        heading: "Events of default and their consequences",
        content: [
          "The events of default section is arguably the most important part of the facility agreement for developers to understand. An event of default gives the lender the right, though not the obligation, to demand immediate repayment of the entire facility, enforce its security by appointing a receiver or exercising its power of sale, and refuse to make any further drawdowns. The consequences of default can be catastrophic for a developer, resulting in the loss of the site, the project, and potentially personal assets if guarantees are in place.",
          "Standard events of default include failure to make any payment when due, breach of any financial covenant, breach of any representation or warranty, insolvency of the borrower or any guarantor, material adverse change in the borrower's financial position or the project, cross-default provisions that are triggered if the borrower defaults under any other lending facility, and failure to achieve practical completion by the longstop date specified in the facility agreement. The longstop date is particularly important. If your facility agreement specifies a completion date of eighteen months and your project overruns, you could be in default even if the project is 95% complete.",
          "In our experience, the events of default that most commonly affect developers are cost overruns that breach the cost-to-complete covenant, programme delays that threaten the longstop date, and failure to maintain required insurance. Each of these situations is manageable if identified early and communicated transparently to the lender. A lender who is informed of a two-month delay with a credible recovery plan is far more likely to grant a waiver or extension than one who discovers the delay from a monitoring surveyor report. If you need help understanding your <a href=\"/guides/how-does-development-finance-work\">development finance</a> obligations, our team can guide you through the process."

        content: [
          "The security package in a development finance facility agreement typically comprises multiple layers of protection for the lender. The primary security is a first legal charge over the development site, which gives the lender the right to sell the property if the borrower defaults. In addition, the lender will usually require a debenture over the borrower company, which creates a fixed and floating charge over all the company's assets, and an assignment of the building contract, professional appointments, and all insurance policies related to the project.",
          "Personal guarantees are standard in development finance, particularly for smaller developers and SPV structures where the borrowing entity has no assets beyond the development site. The guarantee typically covers the full amount of the facility plus interest, costs, and expenses. Some lenders cap the guarantee at a percentage of the facility, say 25-50%, while others require unlimited guarantees. The scope of the guarantee is a key negotiation point and one where experienced borrower solicitors can often achieve better terms. On a £3,000,000 facility, the difference between an unlimited guarantee and one capped at 25% represents potentially millions of pounds of personal exposure.",
          "We also see lenders requiring collateral warranties from the main contractor, architect, and structural engineer. These warranties give the lender the right to step into the developer's shoes and enforce the terms of these appointments if the developer defaults. While collateral warranties are standard in the construction industry, obtaining them can take time and some professionals charge additional fees. It is important to factor this into your pre-completion timeline and ensure that your professional team is aware of the requirement from the outset."

        heading: "Key clauses to negotiate and practical tips",
        content: [
          "While much of the facility agreement is standard, there are several areas where negotiation is possible and advisable. The longstop date should include a reasonable buffer beyond your expected completion date. If your build programme is twelve months, push for an eighteen-month longstop to allow for unforeseen delays. The cost overrun provisions should be realistic; some lenders require the borrower to fund all overruns from equity, while others will consider lending additional funds subject to the project remaining viable. The interest rate default margin, the additional interest charged during a default event, varies significantly between lenders and is worth negotiating.",
          "The drawdown notice period is another negotiable point. Ten working days is standard, but some lenders will agree to five working days for experienced borrowers with a proven track record. The minimum drawdown amount, typically £25,000 to £50,000, can also be negotiated if your build programme involves smaller, more frequent stages. For smaller schemes with a total build cost of £300,000 to £600,000, a minimum drawdown of £50,000 can be restrictive and worth discussing with the lender.",
          "Our practical advice is to instruct a solicitor who regularly acts for borrowers in <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> transactions. They will know which clauses are market standard, which represent aggressive lender positions, and where there is room for negotiation. A good borrower solicitor will produce a detailed report on the facility agreement highlighting key commercial points, risk areas, and recommended negotiations. This report is invaluable and should be discussed thoroughly before the facility agreement is signed. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Submit your deal</a> to us and we will ensure you have access to solicitors who specialise in this area."

          "A Special Purpose Vehicle, or SPV, is a limited company formed specifically to hold a single development project. It has no trading history, no other assets, and no liabilities beyond those related to the development. In the context of <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a>, approximately 85% of lenders require the borrower to be an SPV rather than an individual or an existing trading company. The reason is straightforward: an SPV ring-fences the development project from the developer's other activities, creating a clean and transparent legal structure that simplifies security, administration, and, if necessary, enforcement.",
          "From the lender's perspective, an SPV ensures that the development site and the loan facility are the only significant assets and liabilities within the borrower entity. This means there are no competing creditors, no unrelated debts that could trigger cross-default provisions, and no risk of the borrower's other business activities contaminating the project. If the developer runs a separate construction company that becomes insolvent, the SPV holding the development site is unaffected because it is a separate legal entity.",
          "For developers, the SPV structure provides limited liability protection. If the development fails and the lender enforces its security, the developer's personal assets are protected, subject to any personal guarantees given. The SPV structure also makes it easier to bring in joint venture partners or equity investors, as their investment can be structured as shares in the SPV with clearly defined rights and obligations. We have arranged facilities for SPV structures ranging from simple single-director companies to complex multi-layered structures with holding companies and multiple project SPVs."

        heading: "Setting up your SPV correctly",
        content: [
          "Setting up an SPV for a development finance transaction requires attention to specific details that lenders will scrutinise. The company should be incorporated at Companies House as a private limited company, with a memorandum and articles of association that are appropriate for a property development business. Standard model articles are usually acceptable, but some lenders have specific requirements around director appointments, share transfers, and the company's objects clause.",
          "The SPV's name should clearly identify it as a project-specific entity. Names like '123 High Street Developments Limited' or 'Oakfield Residential SPV Limited' are common. Avoid names that are misleading or that could be confused with established businesses. The registered office address should be a genuine business address, not a virtual office, as some lenders view virtual offices unfavourably. The company should be registered for Corporation Tax with HMRC and, if applicable, registered for VAT.",
          "Directors and shareholders need careful consideration. The developer should be a director of the SPV, and in most cases the sole shareholder or majority shareholder. If there are joint venture partners, the shareholding structure should be agreed before the SPV is incorporated and documented in a shareholders' agreement. Lenders will require details of all directors and persons with significant control as part of their know-your-customer checks. Setting up the SPV typically costs between £50 and £500 depending on whether you use an off-the-shelf company or instruct a solicitor to incorporate a bespoke entity. We advise developers to have the SPV ready before submitting their <a href=\"/deal-room\">finance application</a>, as this avoids unnecessary delays.",
          "One important point that developers often overlook is that the SPV needs a bank account before the lender will complete. Opening a business bank account can take two to six weeks depending on the bank, and some banks are reluctant to open accounts for newly incorporated SPVs with no trading history. Start the account opening process as soon as the SPV is incorporated."

          "The tax treatment of development profits through an SPV differs significantly from development in a personal name. When an SPV sells completed units, the profit is subject to Corporation Tax, currently 25% for profits above £250,000. If the developer then extracts profits from the SPV as dividends, they pay additional income tax on the dividend, resulting in an effective combined tax rate that can exceed 45% for higher-rate taxpayers.",
          "However, there are legitimate tax planning strategies that can make the SPV structure more tax-efficient. If the developer plans to retain completed units as rental investments, they can be transferred to a separate holding company at market value, with the development SPV paying Corporation Tax on the development profit and the holding company benefiting from ongoing rental income within a corporate structure where mortgage interest relief is not restricted as it is for individuals. For a scheme generating £500,000 in profit, the tax planning strategy can make a material difference to the developer's net return.",
          "Stamp Duty Land Tax also needs consideration. When the SPV purchases the development site, SDLT is payable at the standard rates for a company purchase, which includes the 5% surcharge for corporate purchasers of residential property above £250,000. This additional cost should be factored into the development appraisal from the outset. VAT is another consideration; some development activities are zero-rated for VAT purposes, new residential construction specifically, while others are standard-rated or exempt. Incorrect VAT treatment can result in unexpected liabilities. We always recommend that developers take specialist tax advice before committing to an SPV structure, as the optimal approach depends on the individual's wider tax position and long-term investment strategy.",
          "Capital Gains Tax versus Corporation Tax is another consideration. Individuals pay CGT on property disposal profits at rates of up to 24%, while companies pay Corporation Tax at 25%. For some developers, particularly those undertaking occasional one-off projects rather than a series of developments, personal ownership may be more tax-efficient. However, most <a href=\"/guides/how-does-development-finance-work\">development finance</a> lenders will still require an SPV regardless of tax preferences."

A typical <a href=\"/services#equity-jv\">equity joint venture</a> involves one party providing the development expertise and project management, while the other provides the equity capital. Both parties become shareholders in the SPV, with their respective shareholdings reflecting their agreed profit share.",
          "The shareholders' agreement is the key document governing the relationship between the joint venture parties within the SPV. It should address capital contributions and the timing of those contributions, decision-making authority and what constitutes a reserved matter requiring unanimous consent, profit distribution mechanics, deadlock resolution procedures, exit provisions including tag-along and drag-along rights, and the circumstances under which a party can be removed as a director. In our experience, disputes between joint venture partners almost always arise from ambiguity in the shareholders' agreement. Spending £3,000 to £7,000 on a properly drafted agreement is a worthwhile investment.",
          "The SPV's articles of association should be tailored to reflect the shareholders' agreement rather than relying on model articles. This ensures that the company's constitutional documents are consistent with the commercial deal. The lender will review the shareholders' agreement and articles as part of their due diligence, and any provisions that could interfere with the lender's security or its ability to enforce will need to be addressed. Common issues include pre-emption rights on share transfers that could prevent the lender from appointing a receiver, and deadlock provisions that could result in the company being wound up during the development.",
          "For more complex arrangements involving <a href=\"/services#mezzanine-finance\">mezzanine finance</a> alongside senior debt, the SPV structure may involve a holding company sitting above the project SPV. The mezzanine lender takes security over the shares in the project SPV held by the holding company, while the senior lender takes the first legal charge over the property. This layered structure requires careful legal documentation to ensure that the intercreditor arrangements between the senior and mezzanine lenders are properly documented."

          "Once the development is complete and all units are sold, the SPV needs to be wound up. The most common method is a Members' Voluntary Liquidation, or MVL, which is appropriate when the company is solvent and has distributed or is able to distribute all remaining assets to shareholders. An MVL requires the appointment of a licensed insolvency practitioner as liquidator, who oversees the distribution of the company's assets. The cost of an MVL typically ranges from £2,000 to £5,000 plus VAT.",
          "The tax advantage of an MVL is significant. Distributions made during an MVL are treated as capital distributions, subject to Capital Gains Tax rather than income tax. For a basic-rate taxpayer, this means paying CGT at 18% on residential property gains, compared to dividend tax rates that can reach 39.35% for additional-rate taxpayers. If the developer qualifies for Business Asset Disposal Relief, formerly Entrepreneurs' Relief, the effective CGT rate can be as low as 10% on the first £1,000,000 of qualifying gains. This can save a developer tens of thousands of pounds compared to extracting profits as dividends.",
          "Alternatively, if the developer plans to undertake further projects, the SPV can be retained and reused, although most lenders prefer a clean SPV for each new project. Strike-off is a cheaper alternative to MVL for companies with assets below £25,000, but it does not provide the same tax advantages and is not appropriate for companies that have traded actively. We always recommend discussing the wind-up strategy with a tax adviser before the development completes, as some strategies require advance planning. If you are planning a development and want to ensure your SPV structure is optimised from the outset, <a href=\"/deal-room\">submit your deal</a> for a confidential discussion."

          "The most common mistake we see is developers using an existing trading company rather than a dedicated SPV. This creates unnecessary complexity for the lender, who must assess the company's existing debts, creditors, and contractual obligations alongside the development project. It also exposes the developer to the risk that problems in their other business activities could affect the development. A builder who uses their construction company to borrow development finance risks losing the development site if the construction company encounters financial difficulties on other contracts.",
          "Another frequent error is failing to maintain proper corporate governance within the SPV. Development finance lenders expect the SPV to maintain proper accounting records, file annual accounts and confirmation statements at Companies House on time, and comply with all statutory obligations. A late filing penalty or a threat of strike-off can trigger a default under the facility agreement. In our experience, developers who appoint a qualified accountant to manage the SPV's statutory obligations from day one avoid these problems entirely.",
          "Finally, some developers set up multiple SPVs for a single project, typically because they acquired the land in one SPV and want to develop it in another. This creates an unnecessary transfer requirement, potentially triggering additional SDLT and complicating the legal structure. Unless there is a specific tax or commercial reason for a multi-SPV structure, we recommend keeping it simple. One project, one SPV, one clean structure that the lender can understand and underwrite efficiently."

          "Planning permission is the single most important factor in a <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> application because it determines whether the proposed scheme can legally be built. Without valid planning permission, the development site is valued as land with hope value rather than as a consented development opportunity, and the gross development value that underpins the entire financial structure cannot be reliably calculated. In our experience, the type and status of planning permission directly affects the loan-to-value ratio available, the interest rate charged, and whether a lender will consider the application at all.",
          "Lenders view planning permission as a binary risk reducer. A site with full detailed planning permission for twelve residential units has a known, quantifiable development potential. A site with no planning permission is speculative. Between these two extremes lies a spectrum of planning statuses, including outline permission, reserved matters, resolution to grant, permitted development rights, and planning applications pending determination, each of which carries a different level of risk in the lender's assessment.",
          "The practical impact is significant. A residential development scheme in Surrey with full planning permission might attract development finance at 7.5% per annum with 65% loan-to-GDV. The same scheme with only outline permission might only attract 55% loan-to-GDV at 9.5% per annum, if a lender will consider it at all. Understanding how planning status affects your borrowing terms allows you to make informed decisions about when to apply for finance and how much equity you need to contribute."

This means the local planning authority has granted consent for the specific scheme you intend to build, including the number and type of units, the design, layout, access, landscaping, and all other reserved matters. Most mainstream development finance lenders require full planning permission before they will issue a formal facility offer. The permission must be implementable, meaning no pre-commencement conditions remain undischarged that would prevent a lawful start on site.",
          "Outline planning permission establishes the principle of development but reserves detailed matters for subsequent approval. While outline permission provides confidence that the site can be developed, it leaves significant uncertainty about the final scheme. A smaller number of specialist lenders will consider facilities against outline permission, but typically at lower leverage, 50-55% of estimated GDV, and higher rates. The borrower is expected to submit and obtain reserved matters approval during the loan term, which introduces additional planning risk that the lender must price in.",
          "A resolution to grant is a committee decision to approve the application subject to the completion of a Section 106 agreement. This is common for larger residential schemes where affordable housing or infrastructure contributions are required. Some lenders treat a resolution to grant almost as favourably as full permission, particularly if the Section 106 heads of terms are agreed. Others will not lend until the Section 106 is completed and the formal decision notice issued. The time between resolution to grant and formal consent can be anywhere from two to twelve months depending on the complexity of the Section 106 negotiations.",
          "<a href=\"/guides/permitted-development-rights-finance\">Permitted development rights</a> allow certain types of development without the need for a full planning application, most commonly the conversion of commercial premises to residential use under Class MA or Class O of the General Permitted Development Order. Lenders will consider these schemes provided the developer has obtained prior approval from the local authority confirming that the proposed development falls within the permitted development rights. The prior approval process typically takes eight weeks and is a lighter-touch assessment than a full planning application."

          "Having full planning permission does not necessarily mean you can start building immediately. Most planning permissions include conditions, and a significant proportion of these are pre-commencement conditions that must be discharged before any work begins on site. Common pre-commencement conditions include approval of external materials and finishes, submission and approval of a construction management plan, archaeological investigation or watching brief, contamination assessment and remediation strategy, detailed drainage and sustainable urban drainage scheme, and ecological mitigation measures.",
          "Development finance lenders universally require that all pre-commencement conditions are discharged before the first drawdown of construction funds. This is not negotiable. The reason is that starting work without discharging pre-commencement conditions can render the entire planning permission invalid, leaving the lender with security over a site where the development cannot lawfully continue. We have seen cases where developers started work without discharging a pre-commencement contamination condition, and the local planning authority issued an enforcement notice requiring all work to cease until the condition was properly discharged.",
          "Discharging conditions takes time. The local planning authority has eight weeks to determine a discharge of condition application, and in practice it often takes longer. Some conditions require the appointment of specialist consultants, such as archaeologists or ecologists, whose reports must be prepared before the application can even be submitted. We always advise developers to begin the condition discharge process immediately after receiving planning permission, even before they apply for <a href=\"/guides/how-does-development-finance-work\">development finance</a>. This ensures that the conditions are discharged, or close to being discharged, by the time the lender is ready to complete the facility. For schemes with extensive pre-commencement conditions, this parallel processing can save three to four months on the overall project timeline."

          "Planning risk encompasses any uncertainty about whether the proposed development can be built as planned. The most obvious planning risk is the absence of planning permission, but there are more subtle forms. An extant planning permission with a looming expiry date presents risk because the permission lapses if a material start is not made before the deadline. A permission subject to a legal challenge or judicial review is uncertain even though it has been formally granted. A scheme that requires a non-material amendment to the existing permission to accommodate design changes may face refusal.",
          "Lenders price planning risk through three mechanisms. First, they reduce the loan-to-value ratio, requiring the developer to contribute more equity, which provides a larger buffer if the scheme cannot proceed as planned. Second, they increase the interest rate to compensate for the additional risk. Third, they may impose specific conditions in the facility agreement, such as requiring the developer to obtain reserved matters approval within a specified timeframe or to commence development before the planning permission expires.",
          "In our experience, the premium for planning risk is substantial. We recently arranged a facility for a site in Hampshire with full planning permission at 7.8% and 65% LTGDV. An equivalent site with outline permission only attracted 10.2% and 50% LTGDV. The additional cost of planning risk on a £2,000,000 facility over twelve months was approximately £48,000 in additional interest plus £300,000 in additional equity required. This demonstrates why we always recommend that developers secure the most advanced planning consent possible before applying for development finance. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Submit your deal</a> with full planning in place and you will access the best terms available."

They typically require the developer to provide affordable housing units, make financial contributions towards local infrastructure such as schools, healthcare facilities, or transport improvements, deliver public open space or play areas within the development, or undertake off-site highway works. The financial value of Section 106 obligations can be substantial, ranging from £10,000 per unit for minor contributions to over £100,000 per unit in high-value London boroughs.",
          "Development finance lenders treat Section 106 obligations as project costs that must be factored into the development appraisal. If the appraisal does not adequately account for Section 106 costs, the lender will either reduce the facility amount or require the developer to demonstrate how these obligations will be funded. Affordable housing obligations are particularly significant because they require the developer to sell or transfer a proportion of the completed units at below-market prices, directly reducing the scheme's gross development value.",
          "The timing of Section 106 payments also affects cash flow planning. Some obligations are triggered at the commencement of development, others at specific milestones such as occupation of a certain number of units, and others before marketing of the final units. Understanding when <a href=\"/guides/cil-section-106-obligations\">Section 106 payments</a> fall due is essential for structuring the development finance facility to ensure that sufficient funds are available at each trigger point. We have arranged facilities where the Section 106 cash flow was not properly modelled, resulting in the developer needing to inject additional equity midway through the build to meet an obligation that should have been anticipated from the outset."

Start the planning process early, engage with the local authority through pre-application discussions, and use the pre-application feedback to inform your scheme design before submitting the formal application.",
          "If you are purchasing a site with existing planning permission, conduct thorough due diligence on the permission itself. Check the expiry date, review all conditions and identify which are pre-commencement, verify that no legal challenges are pending, confirm that the Section 106 agreement has been completed, and ensure that the permission has not been partially implemented in a way that could cause complications. Your solicitor should review the planning permission as part of the <a href=\"/guides/legal-due-diligence-development-finance\">legal due diligence</a> process, but it helps to be aware of potential issues before you even instruct them.",
          "For developers considering sites without planning permission, consider the sequence carefully. It is almost always more cost-effective to secure planning permission before purchasing the site, using an option agreement or conditional contract to control the site while the planning application is determined. This avoids the need for expensive short-term finance to hold a speculative site while planning is uncertain. If you must purchase before planning, a <a href=\"/services#bridging-loans\">bridging loan</a> is typically the most appropriate funding mechanism, with a refinance into development finance once planning is secured.

For <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> lenders, the Land Registry is the authoritative source for verifying that the borrower owns the site and that the lender can take a valid first legal charge over it.",
          "When you apply for development finance, the lender's solicitor will obtain official copies of the title register and title plan from the Land Registry. These documents cost £3 each and are available online within minutes. The title register comprises three sections: the property register, which describes the land and any rights benefiting it; the proprietorship register, which identifies the owner and any restrictions on their ability to deal with the land; and the charges register, which lists all mortgages, charges, and other financial encumbrances registered against the title.",
          "The title plan shows the extent of the registered title, outlined in red, against an Ordnance Survey base map. Importantly, the Land Registry title plan identifies the general boundaries of the property rather than the exact boundaries. This general boundary rule means that the title plan does not definitively show the precise position of boundary features such as walls, fences, or hedges. This can become relevant in development finance transactions where the proposed building footprint is close to the boundary, as we will discuss later in this guide."

The lender's solicitor will conduct an official search with priority, known as an OS1 search, before completion. This search provides a priority period of thirty business days during which no other registrations can be made against the title. The solicitor must submit the application to register the transfer and the lender's charge within this priority period to ensure that the lender's security ranks ahead of any subsequent interests.",
          "For most straightforward transactions, the registration process is handled by the solicitor as part of the post-completion formalities and takes between two and eight weeks. However, some transactions trigger a requisition from the Land Registry, which is a request for additional information or documentation. Common requisitions include queries about the company's authority to enter the transaction, discrepancies between the transfer and the title plan, and questions about whether the transaction triggers a requirement for consent from a third party. Requisitions add time and cost to the process.",
          "First registrations are more complex. If the development site is unregistered land, the first dealing with the land, whether a sale, mortgage, or long lease, triggers compulsory first registration. The application for first registration requires extensive documentation including the original title deeds, an index map search, a statutory declaration explaining the chain of ownership, and a form DL listing all documents being lodged. First registration typically takes three to six months and can delay the lender's ability to register its charge. We always advise developers to check whether their title is registered before proceeding with a finance application by conducting a Land Registry search. If the title is unregistered, factor in additional time for the first registration process.",
          "The fee for registering a charge at the Land Registry depends on the transaction value. For a development finance facility of £2,000,000, the registration fee is approximately £270. While this is a relatively minor cost in the context of the overall transaction, the consequences of failing to register the charge correctly and within the priority period can be severe for the lender, which is why solicitors treat this step with great care."

A <a href=\"/guides/restrictive-covenants-development\">restrictive covenant</a> is a legal obligation imposed on the land, typically by a previous owner, that restricts how the land can be used or developed. Common restrictive covenants include limitations on the type of building that can be erected, restrictions on the number of dwellings, requirements to maintain the land as open space, and prohibitions on specific uses. If a restrictive covenant conflicts with the proposed development, the lender will require the issue to be resolved before completing the facility.",
          "Options for resolving restrictive covenants include obtaining the consent of the person with the benefit of the covenant, which may involve a payment; obtaining restrictive covenant indemnity insurance, which covers the cost of any claim; or applying to the Upper Tribunal for the covenant to be modified or discharged under Section 84 of the Law of Property Act 1925. Indemnity insurance is the most common solution and can be obtained relatively quickly and inexpensively, typically for a one-off premium of £200 to £5,000 depending on the risk profile. However, the insurer will not cover the cost of complying with the covenant if it is enforced, only the financial loss.",
          "Boundary discrepancies are another frequent issue. The Land Registry title plan may not accurately reflect the physical boundaries on site, particularly for older registrations. If the proposed development extends to the boundary of the title, or if a neighbour disputes the boundary, the lender may require a surveyor's report confirming the extent of the developer's ownership. In extreme cases, a boundary dispute can prevent the development finance transaction from completing until the dispute is resolved, either by agreement or through legal proceedings. We have seen boundary disputes add six to twelve months to a project timeline and cost upwards of £25,000 in legal fees."

This is a standard concurrent discharge and registration that solicitors handle routinely.",
          "Restrictions on the proprietorship register can be more problematic. A restriction limits the registered proprietor's ability to deal with the land. Common restrictions include those requiring consent from a third party before the land can be transferred or charged, restrictions entered by a co-owner requiring their consent, and restrictions entered by the Land Registry automatically when the proprietor is a company. The company restriction requires the solicitor to certify that the transaction does not contravene section 40 of the Companies Act 2006, which is a standard certification but must not be overlooked.",
          "Other incumbrances that can affect development finance transactions include notices of home rights under the Family Law Act 1996, which indicate that a spouse or civil partner has a right of occupation; cautions against first registration, which are used to protect interests in unregistered land; and unilateral notices entered by parties claiming an interest in the land. Each of these entries needs to be investigated and, where necessary, removed before the lender will complete. In our experience, early investigation of the title is the single most effective way to avoid delays.

If the development proposals extend beyond the red-edged boundary, for example where a developer intends to build on an adjoining strip of land that they believe they own but which is not included in the registered title, the lender cannot take security over that additional land without it being registered.",
          "Developers acquiring additional land to assemble a development site need to ensure that all parcels are properly registered and, if necessary, consolidated into a single title. The Land Registry can merge multiple titles into one, which simplifies the security documentation for the lender. Alternatively, the lender may take separate charges over each title. The cost of merging titles is modest, typically £40 to £100, but the process takes several weeks and should be initiated well in advance of the anticipated finance completion date.",
          "For developments involving the subdivision of a larger title, such as a developer purchasing part of a farm or estate for residential development, the title must be split and a new title created for the development site. This requires a transfer of part, which is registered at the Land Registry and results in the creation of a new title number for the transferred land. The title plan for the new title must accurately reflect the extent of the development site. Any rights needed over the retained land, such as access rights or service easements, must be granted in the transfer and registered against both titles.

The solicitor needs to understand what the lender will require so that they can anticipate and address issues proactively.

For development finance transactions, we recommend instructing a solicitor as soon as you have identified the site, even before you have agreed terms with the lender.

          "The limitations of the Minor Works contract become apparent on larger or more complex schemes. It does not include detailed provisions for loss and expense claims, it has limited provisions for dealing with contractor insolvency, and the dispute resolution procedures are less comprehensive than those in the intermediate or design and build forms. Development finance lenders will accept a Minor Works contract for smaller schemes but may require a more robust form for projects above £750,000 in construction value. We have arranged facilities for numerous small developments using the Minor Works form and find that it strikes the right balance between simplicity and protection for projects of appropriate scale."

It is designed for projects of medium value and complexity, typically between £500,000 and £2,000,000 in construction cost, though it can be used for both smaller and larger schemes. The contract includes more detailed provisions for variations, extensions of time, loss and expense, and contractor insolvency than the Minor Works form, while remaining more manageable than the full standard form.",
          "For development finance purposes, the Intermediate Contract is the most commonly used form for residential developments of five to twenty units. It provides the level of risk allocation and contractual protection that lenders expect without the administrative burden of the full standard form. The contract requires the appointment of an architect or contract administrator, a quantity surveyor for financial administration, and allows for the use of named subcontractors. Interim payments are made monthly based on valuations prepared by the quantity surveyor and certified by the contract administrator.",
          "One important feature of the Intermediate Contract is its provisions for contractor insolvency. If the contractor becomes insolvent during the build, the contract automatically terminates, and the developer has the right to engage a replacement contractor to complete the works. The contract also includes provisions for the contractor to provide a retention bond or guarantee, which provides additional security for the developer and, by extension, the lender. In our experience, lenders view the Intermediate Contract favourably because it provides comprehensive protection at a proportionate level of complexity. For schemes in this value range, it is the form we most frequently recommend to developers applying for <a href=\"/guides/how-does-development-finance-work\">development finance</a>."

This is fundamentally different from the traditional procurement route where the developer appoints an architect to design the scheme and a contractor to build it. Under a design and build contract, the contractor is responsible for producing a design that meets the developer's requirements, known as the Employer's Requirements, and for constructing the works in accordance with that design.",
          "For development finance lenders, the design and build contract offers the advantage of single-point responsibility. If there is a defect in the completed development, the developer, and therefore the lender, does not need to determine whether the fault lies with the architect's design or the contractor's workmanship. The contractor is responsible for both. This simplified risk profile is attractive to lenders, and many express a preference for design and build procurement on larger schemes with construction costs above £1,500,000.",
          "The design and build contract uses a different payment mechanism from the traditional contracts. Instead of monthly valuations by an independent quantity surveyor, the contract administrator certifies payments based on the contractor's application and the contract administrator's assessment. The contract sum is typically a fixed lump sum, which provides cost certainty for the developer and the lender. However, the developer's ability to make changes during the build is more restricted under a design and build contract, and variations can be expensive because the contractor controls the design process.",
          "We have arranged numerous facilities where the lender specifically required a design and build contract because of the risk transfer it provides. For a developer undertaking a £3,500,000 residential scheme with twenty units, the design and build form offers cost certainty, single-point responsibility, and a clear contractual framework that the lender's monitoring surveyor can easily administer.

These typically include a collateral warranty from the contractor in favour of the lender, giving the lender the right to enforce the building contract directly against the contractor if the developer defaults. The solicitor will also check for a clause allowing the lender to assign the benefit of the building contract to a purchaser if the lender enforces its security and sells the development site. Without these provisions, the lender's security is weakened because they cannot ensure that the contractor completes the works.",
          "Third, the lender will want to see that the contract includes provisions for professional indemnity insurance, particularly under a design and build contract where the contractor has design responsibility. The minimum level of professional indemnity insurance is typically £2,000,000 to £5,000,000 depending on the size of the project. The insurance must be maintained for a specified period after practical completion, usually six to twelve years. Contractors who do not carry adequate professional indemnity insurance, or who allow their policies to lapse, create a significant risk for the developer and the lender. We always advise developers to verify their contractor's insurance position before entering into a building contract and to include a contractual obligation for the contractor to maintain insurance throughout the relevant period."

For medium-sized residential developments with construction costs of £500,000 to £2,000,000 using traditional procurement, the Intermediate form provides the right balance of protection and practicality. For larger schemes above £1,500,000 or where you want single-point design and construction responsibility, the Design and Build form is the preferred choice.",
          "Whichever form you choose, ensure that the contract is properly completed with all the required particulars, including the contract sum, completion date, retention percentage, liquidated damages rate, and the names of the contract administrator and quantity surveyor. Incomplete contracts are a common issue we see during <a href=\"/guides/legal-due-diligence-development-finance\">legal due diligence</a>, and they can delay the finance completion. Have your solicitor review the contract before it is signed, even if you are using a standard JCT form, to ensure that any amendments are appropriate and that the contract works alongside your facility agreement.",
          "It is also worth noting that development finance lenders increasingly expect to see a fixed-price building contract rather than a cost-plus or remeasurement arrangement. A fixed-price contract gives the lender confidence that the build cost in the development appraisal is reliable, whereas a cost-plus contract introduces uncertainty about the total construction cost. If your contractor is unwilling to commit to a fixed price, discuss this with your broker before submitting your finance application, as it will affect the lender's appetite and the terms available."

They exist to ensure that buildings are safe, energy-efficient, and accessible. Unlike planning permission, which controls what can be built and where, building regulations control how buildings are constructed, covering everything from structural stability and fire safety to ventilation, drainage, and electrical installations. For <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> lenders, building regulations compliance is essential because a building that does not comply cannot be lawfully occupied, cannot be insured, and therefore has limited or no resale value.",
          "The building regulations are set out in a series of Approved Documents, each covering a specific technical area. Part A covers structural safety, Part B covers fire safety, Part F covers ventilation, Part L covers energy conservation, and Part M covers accessibility. The most recent additions include Part O, which addresses overheating in residential buildings, and Part S, which requires electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Each of these parts sets minimum performance standards that the development must meet, and the lender's monitoring surveyor will verify compliance at each inspection stage.",
          "Non-compliance with building regulations can have severe consequences for a development finance transaction. If the building control body identifies non-compliant work, it can issue an enforcement notice requiring the work to be corrected. In extreme cases, it can require the demolition of non-compliant structures. For the lender, non-compliance means that the completed development may not achieve its projected sale prices, because buyers and their mortgage lenders will require evidence of building regulations compliance before completing a purchase. We have seen schemes where non-compliance with Part B fire safety regulations required retrospective remedial works costing over £150,000, turning a profitable development into a marginal one."

Both routes provide the same outcome, a completion certificate confirming that the building complies with the regulations, but the service model differs. Local authority building control operates on a statutory basis and charges fees set by the authority. Private approved inspectors operate commercially and can offer more flexible service levels, often including dedicated project managers and faster response times.",
          "For development finance transactions, lenders will accept either building control route provided the developer can demonstrate that a building control body has been appointed and that the initial notice, or where using the local authority, the building notice or full plans application, has been submitted. The cost of building control varies depending on the size and complexity of the project. For a typical residential scheme of ten units, building control fees range from £5,000 to £15,000 with a local authority, and £8,000 to £20,000 with a private approved inspector.",
          "The choice between local authority and private approved inspector is partly a commercial decision and partly influenced by the nature of the project. Complex schemes, particularly those involving structural alterations, basement construction, or work to existing buildings, may benefit from the dedicated attention of a private approved inspector. Straightforward new-build schemes can be efficiently managed by local authority building control. In our experience, the most important factor is not which route you choose but that you engage with the building control body early and maintain a collaborative relationship throughout the build. A building control officer who is involved from the design stage can identify potential compliance issues before they become expensive problems on site."

For residential buildings over eleven metres in height, the requirements are particularly stringent, including the specification of external wall materials, compartmentation between dwellings, means of escape provisions, and fire detection and alarm systems. The cost of compliance with Part B can significantly affect the build budget, and developers should ensure that their quantity surveyor has priced the fire safety requirements accurately in the development appraisal.",
          "Part L energy conservation requires new dwellings to achieve minimum energy performance standards, including target fabric energy efficiency and target carbon dioxide emission rates. The 2025 update to Part L introduced more stringent standards as a stepping stone towards the Future Homes Standard. Compliance typically requires enhanced insulation, high-performance windows and doors, air source heat pumps or other low-carbon heating systems, and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. These requirements increase build costs by approximately £5,000 to £15,000 per dwelling compared to the previous standards, and this additional cost should be reflected in the development appraisal submitted to the <a href=\"/guides/how-does-development-finance-work\">development finance</a> lender.",
          "Part S electric vehicle charging requires new residential developments to include electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Each dwelling with an associated parking space must have a dedicated charge point with a minimum power output of 7kW. For developments with communal parking, at least one charge point for every five spaces is required. The cost per charge point is typically £800 to £1,500 installed, and for a twenty-unit scheme with twenty parking spaces, this adds £16,000 to £30,000 to the build cost. While this is a relatively small proportion of the overall budget, it is an example of the incremental compliance costs that developers must account for in their appraisals."

At each site inspection, the monitoring surveyor checks that the works comply with the building regulations as well as the approved plans and specification. They will note any areas of non-compliance in their report to the lender, and the lender may withhold drawdown funds until the non-compliance is rectified. This creates a powerful incentive for developers to maintain compliance throughout the build rather than attempting to address issues retrospectively.",
          "The monitoring surveyor works alongside the building control body but serves a different function. The building control officer inspects work at specific stages and issues compliance certificates. The monitoring surveyor assesses the overall quality of construction, the progress against programme, and the cost expenditure against budget. In our experience, the combination of building control inspections and monitoring surveyor visits provides comprehensive oversight that protects both the lender and the developer. A monitoring surveyor who identifies a structural defect at first fix stage, for example, can ensure it is corrected before the lender advances further funds, preventing a far more expensive remediation later.",
          "We always advise developers to maintain a close working relationship with both their building control officer and the lender's monitoring surveyor. Providing access to site records, inspection reports, and compliance certificates proactively demonstrates good project management and builds confidence with the lender. If a compliance issue arises, addressing it transparently and promptly is far better than attempting to conceal it. Monitoring surveyors are experienced professionals who will identify concealed defects, and a lender who discovers that a developer has hidden a compliance issue is likely to take a much harder line than one who is informed of a problem alongside a credible remediation plan."

Without completion certificates, the developer cannot sell the completed units to buyers using mortgages, which in most residential markets represents the vast majority of potential purchasers.",
          "The development finance lender will typically require confirmation that completion certificates have been, or will be, issued as a condition of the final drawdown or as a condition precedent to the release of any retention. Some lenders require completion certificates before they will agree to release individual units from the security for sale. This means that delays in obtaining completion certificates can directly delay unit sales and the repayment of the development finance facility, potentially causing the developer to breach the longstop date in the <a href=\"/guides/development-finance-facility-agreement\">facility agreement</a>.",
          "In our experience, the most common reason for delayed completion certificates is outstanding snagging items identified by the building control body during their final inspection. These might include missing fire stopping, incomplete ventilation systems, absent certification for electrical or gas installations, or deficiencies in the external fire safety provisions. We advise developers to schedule a pre-completion inspection with the building control body several weeks before the anticipated practical completion date.

This can affect the design, orientation, and glazing specification of the development, with implications for both build cost and sales values.",
          "The Building Safety Act 2022 introduced a new regulatory regime for higher-risk buildings, defined as residential buildings of seven or more storeys or eighteen metres in height. These buildings now require a building control authority approval rather than a simple initial notice, and the building control process is more rigorous and time-consuming. For developers of taller residential schemes, the additional regulatory requirements can add three to six months to the pre-construction timeline and increase professional fees by £50,000 to £100,000 depending on the complexity of the scheme.",
          "For development finance applications, these regulatory changes mean that lenders are paying closer attention to building regulations compliance and are more likely to require detailed evidence of compliance at each stage. Build costs submitted in development appraisals must reflect the current regulatory requirements, not historic benchmarks. A development appraisal that uses build cost data from before the latest Part L or Part O amendments will underestimate the true cost of compliance and may result in the lender reducing the facility amount or declining the application. We always advise developers to obtain current build cost estimates from their quantity surveyor or contractor and to ensure that all regulatory requirements are factored into the <a href=\"/guides/how-to-calculate-gdv\">development appraisal</a> from the outset."

In our experience arranging <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> across the UK, environmental issues are among the most common reasons for delays, renegotiations, or even the collapse of transactions. Understanding what environmental searches involve and how to manage the risks they reveal is essential for every developer.",

It is produced by a specialist environmental data provider who analyses a range of databases, historical maps, and regulatory records to assess the environmental risk profile of the site. The search report covers contaminated land registers, historical land use, landfill sites within a specified radius, flooding risk from rivers, surface water, and groundwater, radon gas risk, and industrial pollution sources.",
          "For brownfield development sites, which account for a significant proportion of residential development in England, the environmental search is particularly important. Former industrial land, petrol stations, dry cleaners, gasworks, and even agricultural land that has been subject to intensive pesticide use can all present contamination risks. The cost of remediating contaminated land can range from £20,000 for minor contamination to over £1,000,000 for severely contaminated industrial sites, making it essential that these risks are identified and quantified early in the project lifecycle."

The contaminated land section reports whether the site or nearby land is on the local authority's contaminated land register, and whether it has a history of potentially contaminative use. The report will flag historical uses such as factories, foundries, chemical works, fuel storage, and waste disposal as potential sources of contamination. It will also identify sites within a specified radius, typically 250 to 500 metres, that could present off-site contamination risks through groundwater migration or airborne pollutants.",
          "The flooding section of the report assesses the risk of flooding from rivers, the sea, surface water, and groundwater. It draws on Environment Agency flood maps and other data sources to categorise the site into flood risk zones. Zone 1 represents low risk, Zone 2 represents medium risk, and Zone 3 represents high risk. Development finance lenders are generally comfortable with Zone 1 sites but will require additional assessment for Zone 2 and may decline to lend on Zone 3 sites unless a site-specific flood risk assessment demonstrates that the risk can be mitigated. A Flood Risk Assessment typically costs £2,000 to £8,000 and must demonstrate that the development will be safe for its lifetime and will not increase flood risk elsewhere.",
          "The report also covers radon gas risk, which is relevant for developments in certain geological areas, particularly in Devon, Somerset, and parts of the Midlands. If the site is in a radon-affected area, the lender may require the developer to install radon protection measures during construction, which adds a relatively modest cost of £500 to £2,000 per dwelling. Other sections cover ground stability, mining, subsidence, and proximity to regulated industrial installations.

The Phase 1 assessment is conducted by a qualified environmental consultant and involves a detailed review of the site's history, including historical Ordnance Survey maps, aerial photographs, regulatory records, and a site walkover inspection. The consultant assesses the likelihood of contamination based on the site's history and current condition and produces a report with recommendations for further investigation if necessary. A Phase 1 assessment typically costs £2,000 to £5,000 depending on the size and complexity of the site.",
          "If the Phase 1 assessment identifies a credible contamination risk, the lender will usually require a Phase 2 Intrusive Investigation. This involves soil sampling, groundwater monitoring, and laboratory analysis to determine whether contamination is present and, if so, its nature, extent, and concentration. The Phase 2 investigation is more expensive, typically costing £5,000 to £25,000 depending on the number of boreholes, trial pits, and laboratory analyses required. The results of the Phase 2 investigation determine whether remediation is needed and, if so, what form it should take.",

The cost of remediation must be factored into the development appraisal and funded from the development finance facility or the developer's equity. We have arranged facilities where remediation costs of £250,000 were successfully incorporated into the scheme budget, with the lender advancing funds for remediation as part of the staged drawdown programme.

The FRA must demonstrate that the development is appropriate for the flood risk zone, that it incorporates adequate flood mitigation measures such as raised floor levels, flood-resistant construction, or sustainable drainage systems, and that it does not increase flood risk to surrounding properties. The lender will also want to see that the development can be insured against flood damage at a reasonable cost, as uninsurable developments are effectively unmortgageable.",

A geotechnical investigation, or ground investigation, assesses the physical properties of the soil and rock beneath the site to determine the appropriate foundation design. While not strictly an environmental matter, geotechnical investigations are often conducted alongside Phase 2 environmental assessments and are of significant interest to development finance lenders because unexpected ground conditions are one of the most common causes of cost overruns in construction.",
          "Common geotechnical issues include high water tables requiring dewatering during construction, clay soils subject to shrinkage and swelling that require deeper foundations, made ground from previous demolition or infill that is unstable and may require piling, and the presence of underground obstructions such as old foundations, cellars, or buried services. The cost implications can be substantial. Standard strip foundations for a residential scheme might cost £15,000 to £30,000, whereas piled foundations required due to poor ground conditions can cost £80,000 to £200,000 for the same scheme.",
          "Development finance lenders expect the build cost in the development appraisal to reflect the actual ground conditions. If you have not conducted a geotechnical investigation, you are effectively guessing the foundation costs, and any significant discrepancy between the estimated and actual costs will need to be funded from contingency or additional equity. We always recommend that developers commission a geotechnical investigation before finalising their build costs and submitting their finance application.

A site with identified contamination and a costed remediation plan is a manageable risk that can be priced into the facility. A site where contamination is suspected but unquantified is an unmanageable risk that most lenders will decline. The developer who commissions the right reports and presents the lender with a clear, costed solution will always achieve a better outcome than the developer who hopes that environmental issues will not surface during due diligence.",
          "Finally, ensure that your development appraisal accurately reflects all environmental costs, including search fees, Phase 1 and Phase 2 investigation fees, remediation costs, ongoing monitoring costs, and any additional foundation costs resulting from poor ground conditions. These costs should be itemised separately rather than buried in the contingency, so that the lender can see exactly how environmental risks are being managed and funded. A transparent, well-documented approach to environmental risk demonstrates professionalism and builds confidence with both the lender and the monitoring surveyor who will oversee the project."

        content: [
          "The Party Wall etc. Act 1996 provides a framework for resolving disputes between neighbours where building work affects a shared wall, boundary, or adjacent property. It applies to three categories of work: building on or at the boundary between two properties, carrying out work to an existing party wall or party structure, and excavating within specified distances of neighbouring buildings. For property developers, the Act is relevant to the vast majority of development projects because most urban and suburban sites have neighbouring properties that could be affected by construction works.",
          "The Act requires the building owner, the developer, to serve formal notice on adjoining owners before commencing work that falls within its scope. The notice must describe the proposed works and specify the intended start date. The adjoining owner then has fourteen days to consent to the works or dissent. If they consent, the works can proceed without further formality. If they dissent, or fail to respond within the fourteen-day period, the Act requires the appointment of party wall surveyors to resolve the dispute and prepare a party wall award detailing the permitted works and any protective measures required.",
          "For <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> lenders, party wall compliance is a pre-drawdown requirement. The lender will not release construction funds until the developer can demonstrate that all necessary party wall notices have been served and that either consent has been obtained or a party wall award has been made. This is because non-compliance with the Party Wall Act can result in an injunction preventing the developer from continuing with the works, a risk that no lender is willing to accept. We have seen projects where failure to serve party wall notices before starting work resulted in a neighbour obtaining a court injunction, halting construction for three months and adding £45,000 in legal costs."

          "The Party Wall Act identifies three types of notice, each corresponding to a different category of work. A Section 1 notice, also known as a line of junction notice, is served when the developer intends to build a new wall at or astride the boundary line with an adjoining property. This is relevant for new-build developments where the external wall of the new building will sit on or close to the boundary. A Section 1 notice must be served at least one month before the proposed start date.",
          "A Section 2 notice, known as a party structure notice, is served when the developer intends to carry out work to an existing party wall or party structure. This includes underpinning, raising, demolishing, or cutting into a shared wall. Section 2 notices are particularly common in urban developments where the new scheme involves alterations to terraced or semi-detached properties with shared walls. The notice must be served at least two months before the proposed start date, giving the adjoining owner time to consider the proposals and respond.",
          "A Section 6 notice, known as an adjacent excavation notice, is served when the developer intends to excavate within three metres of a neighbouring building where the excavation will go below the foundation level of that building, or within six metres where the excavation will intersect a line drawn at forty-five degrees from the base of the neighbour's foundations. Section 6 notices are frequently triggered by basement excavations, deep foundations, and underpinning works. The notice must be served at least one month before the proposed start date. In our experience, Section 6 notices are the most commonly overlooked, particularly on developments involving piled foundations. A developer who instructs their party wall surveyor early can identify all required notices and serve them in parallel with the <a href=\"/guides/legal-due-diligence-development-finance\">legal due diligence</a> process, avoiding delays to the drawdown timeline."

          "When an adjoining owner dissents to the party wall notice, the Act requires the appointment of party wall surveyors to resolve the dispute. The building owner appoints their own surveyor, the adjoining owner appoints their surveyor, and the two surveyors jointly appoint a third surveyor to act as an arbiter in case of disagreement. Alternatively, both parties can agree to appoint a single agreed surveyor, which is typically faster and less expensive. The cost of a party wall surveyor ranges from £1,000 to £3,000 per adjoining owner for straightforward cases, but can exceed £10,000 for complex cases involving basement excavations or multiple adjoining owners.",
          "The surveyors prepare a party wall award, which is a legally binding document that sets out the proposed works in detail, records the condition of the adjoining owner's property before work begins through a schedule of condition, specifies any protective measures required such as temporary propping, vibration monitoring, or crack monitoring, and determines who bears the costs of the award. In most cases, the building owner, the developer, bears the reasonable costs of the party wall process, including the fees of the adjoining owner's surveyor.",
          "The timeline for obtaining a party wall award varies significantly. In straightforward cases where the adjoining owner is cooperative, an award can be completed in four to six weeks from the date of the notice. In contentious cases where the adjoining owner is obstructive or has appointed a surveyor who is slow to respond, the process can take three to six months or longer. For developments with multiple adjoining owners, each requiring a separate notice and potentially a separate award, the cumulative timeline can be substantial. We always advise developers to serve party wall notices as early as possible, ideally at the same time as submitting their development finance application, so that the party wall process runs in parallel with the credit and legal due diligence process. A developer who waits until the lender has approved the deal before serving notices can add months to the drawdown timeline."

These costs include the fees of the building owner's surveyor, the fees of each adjoining owner's surveyor which the developer must pay, the cost of the schedule of condition surveys, and the cost of any protective measures specified in the award. For a typical urban development with four adjoining owners, party wall costs can range from £8,000 to £25,000. For complex schemes involving basement excavations or developments adjacent to sensitive structures, costs can exceed £50,000.",
          "The schedule of condition is a particularly important element. This is a detailed photographic and written record of the condition of the adjoining owner's property before work begins. If the adjoining owner claims that the development works have caused damage to their property, the schedule of condition provides the baseline against which the claim is assessed. Without a schedule of condition, the developer has no evidence to rebut a claim, which can result in expensive and protracted disputes. The cost of a schedule of condition survey is typically £500 to £2,000 per property, depending on the size and complexity of the property.",
          "We have seen developments where the party wall costs were not included in the development appraisal, and the developer had to fund them from contingency or personal equity. On a tight scheme, these unexpected costs can affect the profit margin and, by extension, the financial covenants in the facility agreement. Including realistic party wall costs from the outset demonstrates professionalism and builds confidence with the lender. If you are unsure about the party wall implications of your development, consult a party wall surveyor before finalising your appraisal. Most surveyors will provide an initial assessment and fee estimate for £250 to £500."

An adjoining owner who is fundamentally opposed to the development may use the party wall process to delay the start of works, knowing that the developer cannot commence until the award is in place. While the Party Wall Act provides mechanisms to resolve disputes, including the appointment of a third surveyor to determine any matter on which the two appointed surveyors cannot agree, these mechanisms take time.",
          "In our experience, the most effective strategy for managing party wall disputes is proactive engagement with adjoining owners before serving formal notices. A personal visit to explain the proposed development, address concerns, and answer questions can often prevent a dispute from arising. Where concerns are genuine, such as worries about noise, dust, or structural damage, offering specific mitigation measures in advance of the formal notice can build goodwill and encourage consent. We have seen developers offer adjoining owners compensation payments of £1,000 to £5,000 in exchange for consent, which is often far less expensive than the cost of a contested party wall process.",
          "If a dispute does arise, ensure that your party wall surveyor is experienced, responsive, and commercially minded. A surveyor who can build a professional relationship with the adjoining owner's surveyor is more likely to reach agreement quickly than one who adopts an adversarial approach. The development finance lender will want to see evidence that the party wall process is being managed effectively, and a surveyor who can provide regular progress updates and realistic timeline estimates will help maintain the lender's confidence. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Submit your deal</a> early and we can help you coordinate the party wall process alongside your finance application."

For most urban developments, this will include at least two to four adjoining owners, and for larger schemes potentially ten or more.",
          "Appoint a party wall surveyor early, ideally before submitting your finance application. The surveyor will advise on which notices are required, draft the notices, and manage the process on your behalf. Serve notices at the earliest opportunity to start the fourteen-day consent period running. If adjoining owners consent, the process is complete within days. If they dissent, the surveyor appointment and award process begins, and the earlier this starts, the less impact it has on your drawdown timeline.",

        content: [
          "A restrictive covenant is a legally binding obligation attached to land that restricts how the land can be used or developed. Restrictive covenants are created by deed, typically when a landowner sells part of their land and imposes conditions on the buyer to protect the value or character of the retained land. Once created, a restrictive covenant runs with the land, meaning it binds all future owners, not just the original buyer. For property developers, restrictive covenants can present a fundamental obstacle to development if the covenant prohibits or restricts the type of building work proposed.",
          "Common restrictive covenants affecting development sites include covenants restricting the land to residential use only, prohibiting commercial or industrial use; covenants limiting the number of dwellings that can be built on the land; covenants specifying a maximum building height or minimum setback from boundaries; covenants requiring the approval of building plans by the original landowner or their successors; and covenants prohibiting the demolition of existing buildings. Each of these covenants can directly conflict with the developer's proposals and must be addressed before a <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> lender will complete the facility.",
          "The impact of a restrictive covenant on a development finance application depends on the nature of the covenant and the extent to which it conflicts with the proposed scheme. A covenant restricting the number of dwellings to one on a site where the developer proposes to build twelve apartments is a fundamental issue. A covenant requiring building plans to be approved by a management company, where the management company no longer exists, is a technical issue that can usually be resolved through indemnity insurance. In our experience, approximately 30% of development sites in established residential areas have restrictive covenants that require attention during the finance application process."

          "Development finance lenders are concerned about restrictive covenants because a covenant that is enforced could prevent the development from being completed, reduce the value of the completed units, or result in the developer being required to demolish completed works. Each of these outcomes would impair the value of the lender's security and potentially prevent the repayment of the loan. The lender's solicitor will identify any restrictive covenants from the title register and report on their potential impact on the proposed development.",
          "The lender's assessment focuses on three key questions. First, does the covenant conflict with the proposed development? If the covenant prohibits building above two storeys and the proposed development is two storeys, there is no conflict. Second, is the covenant enforceable? A covenant that was imposed over a hundred years ago by a landowner who has since sold all their land may not be enforceable because there is no identifiable person with the benefit of the covenant. Third, if the covenant is both conflicting and potentially enforceable, can the risk be adequately mitigated through insurance or legal mechanisms?",
          "The lender's solicitor will typically provide an opinion on enforceability based on the age of the covenant, whether the person with the benefit can be identified, whether the covenant has been previously breached without enforcement, and the nature of the neighbourhood. A pre-war covenant restricting use to single dwelling houses in an area that is now predominantly apartment blocks may be assessed as low risk because the character of the area has fundamentally changed. However, a recent covenant imposed by a housing estate developer who retains neighbouring land is high risk because the person with the benefit is identifiable and has a clear interest in enforcement. We have seen covenant issues add £5,000 to £50,000 in costs depending on the complexity and the solution required."

        content: [
          "The most common solution to restrictive covenant issues in <a href=\"/guides/how-does-development-finance-work\">development finance</a> transactions is indemnity insurance. Restrictive covenant indemnity insurance is a one-off policy that covers the insured against financial loss arising from the enforcement of the covenant. If the person with the benefit of the covenant takes legal action to enforce it, the insurance policy covers the legal costs of defending the action, any damages or compensation payable, and potentially the cost of complying with an injunction if one is granted.",
          "The cost of restrictive covenant indemnity insurance depends on the risk profile assessed by the insurer. For low-risk covenants, where the person with the benefit cannot be identified or where the covenant has been widely breached without enforcement, premiums are typically £200 to £1,000 for a one-off payment providing cover in perpetuity. For higher-risk covenants, where the beneficiary is identifiable and has a potential interest in enforcement, premiums can range from £2,000 to £10,000 or more. In extreme cases, where the risk is considered high, insurers may decline to provide cover at all.",
          "There is an important limitation that developers must understand: indemnity insurance must be obtained before the person with the benefit of the covenant is approached or notified about the proposed development. If the beneficiary is put on notice of the breach, most insurers will refuse to provide cover because the risk of enforcement has materially increased. This means that the developer must not approach the neighbouring landowner to seek consent before investigating whether indemnity insurance is available. In our experience, the most effective approach is to instruct your solicitor to investigate the covenant, obtain quotes for indemnity insurance, and only approach the beneficiary if insurance is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive. The lender will typically accept indemnity insurance as adequate mitigation provided the level of cover is sufficient and the insurer is reputable.",
          "For development schemes where the covenant is being clearly breached and the risk cannot be adequately insured, the developer's solicitor may recommend applying to the Upper Tribunal under Section 84 of the Law of Property Act 1925 to have the covenant modified or discharged. This process typically takes six to twelve months and costs £10,000 to £30,000 in legal fees and tribunal costs, but it provides a definitive resolution. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Submit your deal</a> and we can advise on the best approach for your specific circumstances."

          "Where the person with the benefit of the covenant can be identified and is willing to negotiate, the simplest solution is to obtain their formal consent to the proposed development. Consent should be documented in a deed of release or deed of variation, which is registered at the Land Registry to provide certainty for the developer, the lender, and future purchasers of the completed units. The cost of obtaining consent varies enormously depending on the beneficiary's expectations. We have seen cases where consent was obtained for a nominal payment of £1, and cases where the beneficiary demanded £250,000 for consent to develop six units.",
          "The price of consent often reflects the beneficiary's bargaining position. If the covenant is clearly enforceable and the proposed development would cause demonstrable harm to the beneficiary's property, the beneficiary is in a strong position and may demand a substantial payment. If the covenant is of doubtful enforceability and the proposed development would have minimal impact on the beneficiary, the bargaining position is weaker. Experienced solicitors can negotiate these arrangements effectively, and the cost of consent should be weighed against the cost of indemnity insurance or a Tribunal application.",
          "The Upper Tribunal can modify or discharge a restrictive covenant under Section 84 of the Law of Property Act 1925 on several grounds. The most commonly used grounds are that the covenant is obsolete due to changes in the character of the neighbourhood, that the covenant impedes a reasonable use of the land and either does not secure practical benefits of substantial value to the beneficiary or is contrary to the public interest. A successful application results in the covenant being formally modified or discharged, providing certainty for the developer and the lender. The Tribunal can also award compensation to the beneficiary for any loss caused by the modification or discharge. While the Tribunal route is slower and more expensive than insurance, it may be the only option for high-value developments where the covenant risk is too great for insurance and the beneficiary will not negotiate."

When a buyer purchases a completed unit, their solicitor will conduct title due diligence and will identify any restrictive covenants affecting the land. If the covenant has been breached by the development and has not been formally released, modified, or insured, the buyer's solicitor may raise this as a requirement before completing the purchase.",
          "Buyers' mortgage lenders are also concerned about restrictive covenant risk. A mortgage lender will not lend against a property where there is a material risk that the property could be subject to an enforcement action. If the restrictive covenant issue has been addressed by indemnity insurance, the buyer's solicitor and mortgage lender will want to see that the policy covers successors in title, meaning it protects the buyer as well as the developer. Most restrictive covenant indemnity policies provide cover in perpetuity and extend to successors, but this should be confirmed before the policy is purchased.",
          "In our experience, addressing restrictive covenant issues thoroughly during the development phase avoids sales delays later. A developer who can provide buyers with either a deed of release, a Tribunal order, or a comprehensive indemnity policy provides clean title that enables smooth sales. A developer who has not addressed the covenant issue may find that buyers' solicitors raise additional enquiries, request additional insurance, or advise their clients to proceed with caution, any of which can delay sales and extend the period over which development finance interest is accruing. The upfront cost of addressing the covenant is almost always less than the cost of delayed sales on a scheme with a £2,000,000 to £5,000,000 facility charging 8-10% per annum."

Restrictive covenants are usually set out in a transfer or conveyance that is referred to in the register, and the full text of the covenant may need to be obtained from the Land Registry or from the original deed. Do not rely solely on the summary in the register; always read the full covenant to understand its scope and the identity of the beneficiary.",
          "Once identified, assess whether the covenant conflicts with your proposed development. If there is no conflict, note this in your legal pack and move on. If there is a conflict, instruct your solicitor to advise on enforceability and to obtain quotes for indemnity insurance before taking any other action. Do not approach the beneficiary at this stage, as this will typically prevent insurance being obtained. If insurance is available at a reasonable cost, purchase the policy and provide it to the lender's solicitor as part of the conditions precedent to drawdown.",
          "If insurance is not available or the premium is prohibitive, consider whether consent from the beneficiary or an application to the Upper Tribunal is the appropriate route. Discuss the options with your solicitor and your broker, as the cost and timeline of each option will affect the overall viability and programme of the development. We always recommend addressing restrictive covenant issues as early as possible in the project lifecycle, ideally before exchanging contracts to purchase the site. Including a covenant resolution strategy in your finance application demonstrates thorough preparation and gives the lender confidence that you have identified and are managing this common risk."

The most common easements encountered in development finance transactions are rights of way, which allow someone to pass over your land to access their property; rights of drainage, which allow someone to run pipes or drains under your land; rights of light, which protect the amount of natural light received by windows in neighbouring buildings; and rights to lay and maintain services such as water, gas, electricity, and telecommunications cables across your land.",

A right of way across the middle of your development site may prevent you from building on that strip of land, requiring a redesign of the scheme. A right of drainage running beneath your proposed building footprint may require the drain to be diverted at the developer's expense.

Registered rights of way are relatively straightforward to identify because they appear on the title register and are often shown by a coloured line on the title plan. Prescriptive rights of way are more problematic because they do not appear on the register and may only come to light when a neighbour asserts their right.",
          "A right of way over a development site typically takes one of two forms: a vehicular right of way, which allows access by car or delivery vehicles, and a pedestrian right of way, which allows access on foot. The width and route of the right of way determine the extent of the constraint on the development. A vehicular right of way typically requires a clear width of at least 3.7 metres, plus additional width for turning if the route includes bends or junctions. A pedestrian right of way requires a minimum width of approximately 1 metre. The land subject to the right of way cannot be built upon, fenced off, or otherwise obstructed.",
          "For development finance purposes, the lender's solicitor will identify all rights of way affecting the site and assess their impact on the proposed scheme. If the scheme design accommodates the existing rights of way, no further action may be needed. If the rights of way conflict with the proposed building layout, the developer will need to either redesign the scheme to accommodate the rights, negotiate a diversion or release of the right of way with the beneficiary, or demonstrate to the lender that the right of way can be overridden. Overriding an easement is possible in some circumstances, such as when the easement was created by implication and the route can be reasonably altered, but this is a complex legal area requiring specialist advice.

Building over service easements is generally prohibited, and a protective strip of one to three metres on either side of the service must usually be kept clear of permanent structures.

          "In our experience, developers who commission a full utilities survey before finalising their scheme design are better placed to manage these constraints. A utilities survey, which typically costs £1,500 to £5,000, identifies the location and depth of all underground services on the site. This information allows the architect to design around existing services or to incorporate service diversions into the scheme design and budget. The cost of diverting a foul water drain typically ranges from £5,000 to £20,000 depending on the length and depth. The cost of diverting a water main or electricity cable is higher, potentially £15,000 to £40,000, and requires the consent and involvement of the relevant utility company. These costs should be reflected in the development appraisal and the <a href=\"/guides/development-finance-facility-agreement\">facility agreement</a> budget."

          "Rights of light are a particularly complex form of easement that affects many urban development sites. A right of light is acquired when a window in a building has received natural light for at least twenty years without interruption. The right protects the amount of light received, not the view. If a proposed development would obstruct the light to a window with a right of light, the owner of that window can seek an injunction to prevent the development or claim damages for the reduction in light.",
          "The potential for a right of light injunction to halt a development makes this one of the most significant legal risks in urban construction. The landmark case of Coventry v Lawrence established that injunctions are the primary remedy for rights of light infringement, and while courts have discretion to award damages instead, they are reluctant to do so where the developer has knowingly proceeded with a scheme that infringes a neighbour's rights. For development finance lenders, the risk of an injunction that prevents the completion or occupation of the development is a fundamental concern that must be addressed before funds are released.",
          "The standard approach to managing rights of light risk is to commission a rights of light survey from a specialist chartered surveyor. The surveyor analyses the impact of the proposed development on all neighbouring windows using a technical methodology based on the Waldram diagram, which measures the amount of sky visible from the centre of each affected room. If the survey identifies significant infringements, the developer has several options: redesign the scheme to reduce the impact, negotiate a release or deed of consent with the affected neighbours, or obtain rights of light insurance to cover the risk of a claim. The cost of a rights of light survey ranges from £3,000 to £15,000 depending on the number of affected properties, and the cost of insurance or consent payments varies widely depending on the severity of the infringement. We have arranged <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> for schemes where rights of light costs exceeded £75,000, but the developer had identified and budgeted for these costs from the outset."

          "As well as managing existing easements that burden your development site, you may need to create new easements for the benefit of the completed development. The most common scenario is where the development site does not have direct access to a public highway and requires a right of way over neighbouring land. Without a legally secure right of access, the completed units will be unmortgageable because buyers' lenders will not lend on properties without guaranteed access. This directly affects the developer's exit strategy and is a critical concern for the development finance lender.",
          "New easements are created by deed, which must be registered at the <a href=\"/guides/land-registry-requirements-development\">Land Registry</a> against both the dominant and servient titles. The grant of a new easement typically requires the consent and cooperation of the servient landowner, who may require a payment in exchange. The amount payable depends on the nature and impact of the easement. A simple pedestrian right of way across a neighbouring garden might be obtained for £1,000 to £5,000. A vehicular right of way providing the sole access to a development of twenty units could cost £50,000 to £200,000 or more, reflecting the significant benefit to the development and the burden on the servient land.",
          "The development finance lender will require evidence that all necessary easements are in place before completing the facility. If a new easement is being created as part of the site acquisition, the lender's solicitor will review the terms of the easement to ensure it is adequate for the proposed development and for all future owners and occupiers of the completed units. An easement that is too narrow, too restrictive in terms of permitted use, or subject to conditions that could be onerous will not satisfy the lender's requirements. We always advise developers to agree the terms of any new easements with the grantor and have them reviewed by the lender's solicitor before exchanging contracts on the site purchase. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Submit your deal</a> to ensure your access arrangements are structured correctly from the start."

Obtain official copies of the title register and title plan from the Land Registry at the start of the project and review them carefully with your solicitor. Identify all easements that burden the site and all easements that benefit the site. Commission a utilities survey to identify any service easements that may not be evident from the title documents alone. If the site is in an urban area, consider commissioning a rights of light survey before finalising the scheme design.",
          "Once easements are identified, assess their impact on the proposed scheme. Can the scheme be designed to accommodate existing easements without affecting the number of units, the building layout, or the sales values? If the scheme can work around the easements, document this in your development appraisal and include any additional costs, such as building foundations that span a drain or providing alternative access routes. If the easements require negotiation with neighbours, diversion of services, or rights of light insurance, budget for these costs and include them in the appraisal as identifiable line items.",
          "Finally, keep the lender and its solicitor informed about easement issues throughout the process. A lender who is told about a right of way issue at the application stage, with a clear explanation of how it will be resolved and at what cost, is far more likely to proceed than a lender who discovers the issue during legal due diligence and wonders what else the developer has failed to disclose. Transparency and preparation are the two qualities that development finance lenders value most highly, and they are especially important when dealing with the complex title issues that easements present."

          "Listed building consent is a separate form of permission required for any works to a listed building that would affect its character as a building of special architectural or historic interest. This applies to both internal and external works, making it significantly more restrictive than planning permission, which generally only controls external alterations. In England, there are approximately 400,000 listed buildings, graded I, II*, or II depending on their significance. Grade I buildings are of exceptional interest, Grade II* buildings are particularly important, and Grade II buildings are of special interest. The vast majority, approximately 92%, are Grade II.",
          "For property developers, listed building consent is required whenever the proposed works would alter the character of the building. This includes obvious alterations such as changing windows, adding extensions, or demolishing internal walls, but also less obvious works such as replacing historic plaster, removing original fireplaces, or installing modern building services in a way that affects historic fabric. The test is whether the works affect the building's special interest, and local planning authorities take a broad view of what constitutes special interest.",
          "The relevance to <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> is that listed building consent is a separate legal requirement from planning permission and must be obtained before works commence. A developer who has planning permission for a residential conversion of a listed building but does not have listed building consent cannot lawfully start work. More seriously, carrying out unauthorised works to a listed building is a criminal offence that can result in prosecution, unlimited fines, and a requirement to reverse the unauthorised alterations. Development finance lenders are acutely aware of these risks and will require evidence that listed building consent has been obtained before releasing any funds."

        content: [
          "Listed building status affects a development finance application in several important ways. First, the build cost for listed building projects is typically 20-40% higher than for equivalent non-listed schemes because of the requirement to use traditional materials and construction methods, the need for specialist tradespeople such as stonemasons, lime plasterers, and heritage joiners, and the additional time required for careful, conservation-led construction. A residential conversion of a Grade II listed former school that might cost £1,200,000 to convert if it were not listed could cost £1,600,000 to £1,700,000 with heritage constraints factored in.",
          "Second, the construction programme for listed building projects is longer because of the additional care required during construction and the need to comply with conditions attached to the listed building consent. Heritage conditions often require the developer to submit detailed method statements for specific elements of the work, to use named materials or techniques approved by the conservation officer, and to allow the conservation officer access to inspect works at critical stages. These conditions add time and cost to the project, both of which must be reflected in the development appraisal.",
          "Third, the pool of lenders willing to finance listed building projects is smaller than for standard developments. Some lenders exclude listed buildings entirely because of the additional construction risk and the restrictions on the use of the completed building. Others will lend but at lower loan-to-value ratios and higher interest rates to compensate for the additional risk. In our experience, approximately 40-50% of development finance lenders will consider listed building projects, and rates are typically 1-2% higher than for equivalent non-listed schemes. A facility for a Grade II listed conversion might be offered at 9-11% compared to 7.5-9% for a standard <a href=\"/guides/how-does-development-finance-work\">development finance</a> deal."

The listed building consent application must include detailed drawings showing the proposed works, a heritage impact assessment explaining how the works affect the building's special interest and how the impact has been minimised, and a design and access statement if required by the local authority.",
          "The heritage impact assessment is a critical document that the conservation officer will scrutinise carefully. It should be prepared by a heritage consultant or conservation architect with experience of listed building projects. A well-prepared heritage impact assessment demonstrates that the developer understands the significance of the building and has designed the scheme to preserve and enhance that significance while achieving a viable development. The cost of a heritage impact assessment typically ranges from £2,000 to £8,000 depending on the complexity of the building and the proposed works.",
          "The determination period for listed building consent is eight weeks for straightforward applications and thirteen weeks for major applications, the same as for planning permission. However, listed building consent applications are sometimes referred to Historic England for comment, particularly for Grade I and Grade II* buildings or where the proposed works are extensive. Historic England's involvement can add several weeks to the determination period. In areas with active conservation advisory committees, the application may also be considered by the committee, adding further time. We always advise developers to engage with the local authority's conservation officer before submitting the application through a pre-application consultation. This allows the developer to understand the conservation officer's concerns and to modify the proposals before the formal application, reducing the risk of refusal and the associated delays.",
          "For development finance purposes, the lender will require both planning permission and listed building consent to be in place before completing the facility.

For developers working on sites within conservation areas, these additional controls can affect both the scheme design and the build cost.",
          "The most significant conservation area restriction for developers is the additional scrutiny of design quality. New development within a conservation area must preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the area. This means that the local planning authority, advised by its conservation officer, may require specific materials, architectural detailing, building heights, and roof forms that are sympathetic to the historic environment. These requirements can increase build costs, particularly where natural stone, handmade bricks, natural slate, or bespoke joinery are specified instead of modern equivalents.",

Prior to October 2012, approved alterations to listed buildings were zero-rated for VAT purposes, which meant that the developer did not pay VAT on the construction costs of such works. This relief was abolished in 2012, and most alterations to listed buildings are now subject to the standard rate of VAT at 20%.",
          "However, certain categories of work remain eligible for reduced or zero-rated VAT treatment. The conversion of a non-residential listed building to residential use may qualify for the reduced rate of 5% VAT on construction services and building materials, provided the building has not been lived in during the previous two years. A new residential building constructed within the curtilage of a listed building, such as a new dwelling in the grounds of a listed house, may qualify for zero-rated VAT if it constitutes a new build rather than an alteration or extension. The VAT savings can be significant. On a listed building conversion with construction costs of £800,000, the difference between standard-rated VAT of £160,000 and reduced-rate VAT of £40,000 is £120,000, which can be the difference between a viable scheme and an unviable one.",
          "Development finance lenders expect the development appraisal to reflect the correct VAT treatment of the proposed works. An appraisal that incorrectly assumes zero-rated VAT treatment when the works are actually standard-rated will overstate the scheme's profitability and may result in the lender approving a facility based on incorrect financial information. We always recommend that developers obtain specialist VAT advice before finalising their development appraisal, particularly for listed building projects where the VAT treatment is complex and the financial impact is significant."

For property developers, the most significant PD rights are those that allow the change of use of commercial buildings to residential dwellings. These rights, set out in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015, as amended, have created a significant market for commercial-to-residential conversions, particularly in town centres and business parks where office and retail demand has declined.",
          "The most commonly used PD right for conversions is Class MA, which permits the change of use from Class E commercial, business and service uses to Class C3 residential dwellinghouses. Class E encompasses a wide range of uses including offices, retail, restaurants, light industrial, gyms, and health centres. Class MA replaced the previous Class O office-to-residential right and broadened the scope of PD conversions significantly. In our experience arranging <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> for PD schemes, the volume of transactions has increased substantially since the introduction of Class MA.",
          "It is important to understand that PD rights are not an automatic entitlement. The developer must apply to the local planning authority for prior approval, which is a lighter-touch assessment than a full planning application but still involves scrutiny of specific matters including transport and highways, contamination, flooding, the impact on the character of the area, and adequate natural light in the proposed dwellings. The prior approval process takes fifty-six days from the date the application is received by the local planning authority, and the authority can either grant prior approval, refuse it, or determine that prior approval is not required."

The building must have been in a Class E use for at least two continuous years immediately before the date of the prior approval application. This prevents developers from acquiring a building with a non-Class E use, briefly changing its use to Class E, and then immediately converting it to residential under PD rights. Evidence of the two-year use is required as part of the prior approval application and may include business rates records, lease agreements, or other documentary evidence.",
          "There is a size limit of 1,500 square metres of floorspace that can be converted under a single Class MA right. For larger buildings, only 1,500 square metres can be converted under PD, and any additional conversion would require a full planning application. The building must not be in an area excluded from Class MA rights, which includes certain conservation areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks, and sites of special scientific interest, where the local planning authority has made an Article 4 direction removing PD rights.",
          "Article 4 directions are particularly significant for developers because they remove PD rights in specific areas, requiring a full planning application for any change of use. Numerous London boroughs and other authorities have made Article 4 directions removing Class MA rights in their commercial centres to prevent the loss of employment floorspace. Before acquiring a building for PD conversion, developers must check whether an Article 4 direction applies. A check of the local authority's planning records and a pre-application enquiry will confirm the position. We have seen developers purchase buildings for PD conversion only to discover that an Article 4 direction prevents them from using PD rights, leaving them with a building that requires full planning permission for a residential conversion, a significantly more uncertain and time-consuming process.",
          "Financial contributions are another consideration. Since April 2021, Class MA conversions are liable for <a href=\"/guides/cil-section-106-obligations\">Community Infrastructure Levy</a> where applicable. The CIL charge varies by local authority and can range from £0 in areas without a charging schedule to over £200 per square metre in high-value areas such as parts of Greater London. On a 1,000 square metre conversion, a CIL charge of £150 per square metre represents a cost of £150,000, which must be factored into the development appraisal."

On one hand, the prior approval process is faster and less uncertain than a full planning application, which reduces planning risk. On the other hand, PD conversions are subject to specific limitations, such as the size cap and the adequacy of natural light requirement, which can affect the scheme's viability and saleability. The lender's primary concerns are whether the prior approval has been validly obtained, whether the proposed units meet current space and amenity standards, and whether the completed units will be mortgageable.",
          "The mortgageability of completed PD conversion units is a critical consideration for the developer's exit strategy. Some mortgage lenders are cautious about PD conversions because the units may not benefit from the same standard of amenity as units built under full planning permission. Specifically, PD conversions are not required to provide private outdoor amenity space, car parking, or contributions to affordable housing or local infrastructure. While this reduces the developer's costs, it can also reduce the attractiveness of the completed units to buyers and their mortgage lenders.",
          "In our experience, PD conversion schemes are financeable by a wide range of development finance lenders, but the terms reflect the specific risk profile. Typical loan-to-GDV ratios for PD schemes are 60-65%, with interest rates of 8-10% per annum. Build costs for commercial-to-residential conversions vary significantly depending on the condition and configuration of the existing building. A straightforward office-to-residential conversion might cost £800 to £1,200 per square foot, while a more complex conversion requiring structural alterations, new floors, or upgraded building services could cost £1,500 to £2,500 per square foot.

The principle has already been established by the PD right itself. The authority can only refuse prior approval on the specific grounds set out in the legislation. This means that objections from neighbours about the principle of converting an office to flats are not relevant grounds for refusal. However, if the authority determines that the natural light in one or more proposed units is inadequate, it can refuse prior approval for those specific units.",

Commission a measured survey of the building to accurately assess the gross internal area and the net lettable area after conversion.",
          "Prepare a detailed development appraisal that reflects the true cost of conversion, including structural works, building regulation compliance, fire safety upgrades, sound insulation, new building services, fit-out costs, and professional fees. PD conversion costs are often underestimated by developers who compare them to new-build costs without accounting for the additional complexity of working within an existing building structure. We have seen conversion costs exceed new-build costs on a per-square-foot basis when the existing building requires significant structural intervention.",
          "Ensure that the proposed unit sizes and layouts meet the nationally described space standard, even though PD conversions are not technically required to comply with it. Units that meet the space standard are more attractive to buyers and more likely to be accepted by mortgage lenders. Studios should be at least 37 square metres, one-bedroom flats at least 50 square metres, and two-bedroom flats at least 61 square metres. Designing units to meet these standards from the outset avoids saleability issues later. Finally, budget for the costs of obtaining an EPC rating of at least C for each unit, as this is increasingly required by mortgage lenders and will become a mandatory minimum standard for rental properties. A comprehensive, well-prepared application that addresses all of these points will achieve the best finance terms from the widest range of <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> lenders."

        heading: "What are CIL and Section 106 obligations?",
        content: [
          "The Community Infrastructure Levy and Section 106 obligations are the two principal mechanisms through which local planning authorities require developers to contribute to the infrastructure and services needed to support new development. While they serve similar purposes, they operate in fundamentally different ways. CIL is a fixed charge calculated by reference to the type and size of development, set by the local authority in a published charging schedule. Section 106 obligations are negotiated on a site-specific basis between the developer and the planning authority as a condition of planning permission.",
          "For <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> applications, both CIL and Section 106 obligations represent significant project costs that must be factored into the development appraisal. Failure to account for these costs accurately can result in a scheme that appears profitable on paper but is actually unviable once all planning obligations are included. In our experience, planning levies are one of the most frequently underestimated costs in development appraisals, particularly for developers who are new to a specific local authority area and are unfamiliar with the local charging schedule and Section 106 policy.",
          "The combined cost of CIL and Section 106 obligations varies enormously by location and scheme type. In outer London boroughs, CIL charges for residential development can range from £50 to £250 per square metre, while in central London some boroughs charge over £400 per square metre. Section 106 contributions for affordable housing, transport, education, and health can add a further £10,000 to £100,000 or more per unit. For a twenty-unit residential scheme in a borough with high CIL rates and significant Section 106 requirements, the total planning levy cost can exceed £500,000, which is a material proportion of the total development cost."

      {
        heading: "How CIL is calculated and when it is payable",
        content: [
          "CIL is calculated using a simple formula: the net additional floorspace created by the development, measured in square metres, multiplied by the CIL rate set in the local authority's charging schedule, indexed to account for construction cost inflation since the charging schedule was adopted. The net additional floorspace is the gross internal area of the new development minus any existing floorspace that has been in lawful use for at least six continuous months within the previous three years. This means that if you are demolishing an existing building with 500 square metres of lawful floorspace and replacing it with a building of 1,500 square metres, the CIL charge is calculated on the net additional 1,000 square metres.",
          "The CIL liability becomes due when development commences, which is typically defined as the date on which any material operation is carried out on the site. This can include demolition, site clearance, or the digging of foundations. The developer must submit a CIL commencement notice to the local authority before starting work, confirming who will be liable for the CIL payment and when development will commence. Failure to submit a commencement notice can result in surcharges and the loss of any instalment payment arrangements.",
          "CIL payment terms vary by local authority. Some authorities require full payment within sixty days of commencement. Others offer instalment policies that allow the CIL to be paid in stages over the construction period. A typical instalment policy might require 25% within sixty days of commencement, a further 25% at six months, and the balance at twelve months. For a CIL liability of £200,000 on a development with a twelve-month build programme, an instalment policy can significantly ease the cash flow burden. Development finance lenders will factor the CIL payment schedule into the facility drawdown programme, and in some cases, CIL can be funded from the development finance facility. We always check the local authority's instalment policy when preparing a finance application and model the CIL payments into the cash flow accordingly."

        heading: "CIL exemptions and relief",
        content: [
          "Several exemptions and reliefs are available that can reduce or eliminate the CIL liability. The most significant for residential developers are social housing relief, which exempts affordable housing from CIL, and self-build exemption, which exempts dwellings built by individuals for their own occupation. Social housing relief applies to units that meet the definition of social housing in the CIL regulations, including affordable rent, social rent, shared ownership, and other qualifying tenures. For a scheme that includes 30% affordable housing under a Section 106 agreement, the CIL relief on the affordable units can save tens of thousands of pounds.",
          "Self-build exemption is available for individual plots within a development where the end user will build and occupy the dwelling themselves. The exemption must be claimed before commencement, and the applicant must demonstrate that they intend to occupy the dwelling as their principal residence for at least three years. This exemption is most relevant for small developers selling serviced plots rather than completed houses. The developer's own units, built for sale to the open market, do not qualify for self-build exemption.",
          "There is also a vacancy exemption that applies where the development involves the conversion or demolition of a building that has been vacant and unused for at least six continuous months at the date the planning application was submitted. The floorspace of the vacant building is deducted from the CIL calculation, potentially reducing the liability to zero if the new development is no larger than the existing building. This exemption is particularly valuable for developers converting large commercial buildings to residential use. On a conversion of a 2,000 square metre vacant office building to residential flats with no increase in floorspace, the vacancy exemption can eliminate the entire CIL liability, a saving that could exceed £300,000 in a high-CIL area. We always investigate whether exemptions or reliefs apply when structuring a <a href=\"/guides/how-does-development-finance-work\">development finance</a> application, as the financial impact can be transformative."

        content: [
          "Section 106 obligations are negotiated between the developer and the local planning authority as part of the planning application process. Unlike CIL, which is a fixed charge, Section 106 obligations are site-specific and can cover a wide range of requirements including affordable housing provision, transport improvements, education contributions, healthcare contributions, public open space, ecological mitigation, and employment and training initiatives. The scope and value of Section 106 obligations are guided by the local authority's planning policies and supplementary planning documents.",
          "Affordable housing is typically the most significant Section 106 obligation. Most local planning authorities require developments above a threshold, usually ten units or more, to provide a proportion of affordable housing, commonly 25-40% of the total units. The affordable housing can be provided on-site, which means building and transferring units to a registered provider at below-market values, or off-site through a commuted sum payment to the local authority. An on-site affordable housing obligation of 30% on a twenty-unit scheme means six units must be provided as affordable, at values that are typically 40-60% below open market value. The impact on the scheme's gross development value and profitability is substantial.",
          "Section 106 obligations are legally binding and must be completed before the planning permission can be issued. The negotiation process can take weeks or months, particularly where the developer is seeking to reduce the affordable housing requirement on viability grounds. A viability assessment, prepared by a qualified surveyor to demonstrate that the proposed Section 106 obligations render the scheme unviable, can cost £5,000 to £20,000 and may result in a reduced obligation. In our experience, viability assessments are a legitimate and effective tool for managing Section 106 costs, particularly in areas where the standard affordable housing requirement is 35% or more and build costs are high. The development finance lender will expect the Section 106 obligations to be finalised and the agreement completed before the facility is offered, as the obligations directly affect the scheme's financial viability and the lender's assessment of the <a href=\"/deal-room\">deal</a>."

          "Accurate modelling of CIL and Section 106 costs in the development appraisal is essential for a successful development finance application. The CIL calculation should be based on the local authority's current charging schedule, indexed to the latest index figures published by RICS. The floorspace figures should be based on the measured gross internal area of the proposed development, less any deductions for existing lawful floorspace. The calculation should account for any available exemptions or reliefs, with supporting documentation to demonstrate eligibility.",
          "Section 106 costs should be based on the agreed heads of terms or the completed Section 106 agreement. If the agreement has not yet been completed, the appraisal should include an estimate based on the local authority's standard policy requirements, with a note explaining that the final obligation is subject to negotiation. Affordable housing costs should be modelled by replacing the open market values of the affordable units with the transfer values agreed with the registered provider, typically 40-60% of open market value for shared ownership and 30-50% for affordable rent.",
          "The timing of CIL and Section 106 payments should be modelled in the project cash flow to ensure that sufficient funds are available at each payment trigger. If the CIL is payable within sixty days of commencement, the initial drawdown must include sufficient funds to cover the payment. If Section 106 contributions are triggered at specific milestones, the drawdown schedule must align with these triggers. In our experience, the developers who achieve the best outcomes are those who present the lender with a comprehensive appraisal that fully accounts for all planning levy costs, demonstrates the scheme's viability after these costs, and includes a cash flow that shows exactly when each payment falls due. This level of detail gives the lender confidence in the borrower's professionalism and the scheme's deliverability."

        content: [
          "The planning levy landscape continues to evolve, and developers need to stay informed about changes that could affect their schemes. The Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023 introduced provisions for a new Infrastructure Levy that is intended to replace both CIL and most Section 106 obligations with a single, mandatory levy charged on the value of development. While the Infrastructure Levy is still in the pilot stage and full implementation is not expected for several years, developers and lenders are monitoring its progress closely because it could fundamentally change the way planning contributions are calculated and collected.",
          "In the meantime, several local authorities have revised their CIL charging schedules upwards, reflecting increased development values and construction cost inflation. Developers who rely on outdated CIL rates when preparing their development appraisals risk understating their costs. We always recommend checking the local authority's current charging schedule before submitting a finance application and, where possible, confirming the CIL liability directly with the authority's CIL team.",
          "The interplay between CIL and Section 106 is also evolving. The CIL regulations prohibit the pooling of Section 106 contributions from more than five developments towards a single infrastructure project, directing infrastructure funding towards CIL instead. This has led some authorities to reduce their Section 106 requirements for infrastructure while increasing their CIL rates. For developers, the net effect depends on the specific authority and the type of development. We keep a close watch on these changes across all <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> markets and ensure that our clients' appraisals reflect the current regulatory position. If you are planning a development and need clarity on the planning levy costs for your site, <a href=\"/deal-room\">submit your deal</a> and we will provide a detailed assessment."

In our experience arranging <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> across the UK, this process typically takes four to eight weeks for straightforward transactions and eight to twelve weeks for more complex deals. Understanding each step of the process, and preparing for it in advance, can significantly reduce the time to first drawdown and get your project started sooner.",
          "The completion process involves multiple parties working in parallel: the borrower's solicitor, the lender's solicitor, the valuer, the monitoring surveyor, and potentially other professionals such as party wall surveyors, environmental consultants, and building control officers. Each party has specific tasks to complete and information to provide, and the overall timeline is determined by the slowest element. A delay in obtaining a valuation, for instance, can hold up the entire process even if all other elements are ready.",
          "We have arranged hundreds of development finance facilities and have refined a process for managing completions efficiently. The key insight is that many of the completion requirements can be anticipated and prepared in advance of the facility offer. By the time the lender issues its offer, the developer should already have a solicitor instructed, a valuation booked or completed, searches ordered, party wall notices served, and a comprehensive legal pack assembled. This parallel processing approach is the single most effective way to accelerate the completion timeline."

          "The facility offer sets out the principal terms of the loan including the facility amount, interest rate, arrangement fee, loan term, drawdown schedule, financial covenants, and conditions precedent. The developer should review the offer carefully, comparing it to the terms discussed during the application process and identifying any points that differ from expectations. Points that are commonly negotiated at this stage include the longstop date, the minimum drawdown amount, the interest rate margin, the arrangement fee, and the scope of personal guarantees.",
          "Once the offer is accepted, the developer instructs their solicitor to act on the transaction. Simultaneously, the lender instructs its own solicitor. The two solicitors will communicate directly throughout the completion process, and the speed of their interaction is a major determinant of the overall timeline. We always recommend that developers instruct a solicitor who has specific experience in development finance transactions, as this ensures efficient communication with the lender's solicitor and avoids delays caused by unfamiliarity with standard development finance documentation.",
          "The lender also instructs a valuer to prepare a Red Book valuation of the development site and the proposed completed development. The valuation covers the current market value of the site, the estimated gross development value of the completed scheme, the estimated build cost, and the residual site value. For a typical residential development, the valuation fee ranges from £3,000 to £8,000 depending on the size and complexity of the scheme. The lender may also instruct a monitoring surveyor at this stage, who will prepare an initial report on the build cost budget, the construction programme, and the proposed drawdown schedule. Monitoring surveyor instruction fees typically range from £1,500 to £3,000 for the initial report, with subsequent inspection fees of £500 to £1,500 per visit."

          "The <a href=\"/guides/development-finance-facility-agreement\">facility agreement</a> will contain a list of conditions precedent, or CPs, that must be satisfied before the lender will make the first drawdown. These CPs represent the lender's checklist of requirements that ensure the security is in place, the legal documentation is correct, and the project is ready to proceed. Typical CPs for a development finance facility include satisfactory title investigation and clear title to the development site, satisfactory valuation and monitoring surveyor reports, evidence that all planning permissions are in place with pre-commencement conditions discharged, executed building contract with the approved contractor, evidence of all required insurances including contractor's all risks, public liability, and employer's liability, payment of the arrangement fee, evidence that the borrower's equity contribution has been invested or is available, executed facility agreement, debenture, and personal guarantees, and company searches and know-your-customer verification.",
          "The CPs that most frequently cause delays are planning condition discharges, which can take eight to twelve weeks if not started early; the building contract, which may require amendments to satisfy the lender's solicitor; insurance, where obtaining the correct policies with the required endorsements can take two to four weeks; and the borrower's equity contribution, which must be evidenced in the SPV's bank account or paid into the solicitor's client account before completion.",
          "We always provide developers with a checklist of anticipated CPs at the application stage, before the facility offer is issued, so that they can begin assembling the required documentation in advance. A developer who has their building contract signed, insurance in place, planning conditions discharged, and equity available can move through the CP process in two to three weeks. A developer who has not prepared for any of these requirements may need six to eight weeks or more. The difference in interest cost on a £2,000,000 facility at 8% per annum between a three-week and an eight-week completion process is approximately £13,000, a real financial cost of poor preparation."

The process follows a carefully choreographed sequence that the solicitors on both sides manage collaboratively.",
          "In the days leading up to completion, the lender's solicitor confirms that all CPs have been satisfied and prepares a certificate of title, which is a formal confirmation to the lender that the title to the development site is good and marketable, that the lender's charge will be a valid first legal charge, and that there are no material issues arising from the due diligence process. The borrower's solicitor ensures that all documents requiring the borrower's signature are executed, that the equity funds are in place, and that any existing charges on the title can be discharged simultaneously with completion.",
          "On the day of completion, the sequence typically proceeds as follows: the borrower's solicitor confirms that all documents have been signed and equity funds are in place; the lender's solicitor confirms that all CPs are satisfied and instructs the lender to release the funds; the lender transfers the drawdown amount to the lender's solicitor's client account; the lender's solicitor transfers the funds to the borrower's solicitor's client account; the borrower's solicitor uses the funds to complete the site purchase if applicable, discharge any existing charges, and transfer the net proceeds to the borrower's bank account.

The first drawdown does not usually include any construction costs, as these are released in subsequent drawdowns as the build progresses.",
          "Subsequent drawdowns follow the process set out in the facility agreement. The developer submits a drawdown request to the lender, specifying the amount requested and the works that have been completed since the last drawdown. The lender instructs the monitoring surveyor to inspect the site and verify that the claimed works have been completed to the required standard and that costs are in line with the approved budget. The monitoring surveyor prepares a report recommending the drawdown amount, which may be the full amount requested, a reduced amount if works are behind schedule or quality issues are identified, or a nil recommendation if there are significant concerns.",
          "The typical time from drawdown request to receipt of funds is five to fifteen working days, depending on the lender's internal processes and the monitoring surveyor's availability. Some lenders offer faster turnaround for experienced borrowers with established track records. Understanding this timeline is essential for cash flow planning, as the developer must fund contractor payments from working capital during the period between drawdown requests. We always advise developers to maintain a working capital buffer of at least one month's contractor costs to bridge the gap between drawdowns. For a scheme with monthly contractor costs of £75,000, this means keeping £75,000 available outside the development finance facility. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Submit your deal</a> and we will structure the drawdown programme to align with your build programme and cash flow requirements."

        content: [
          "The most common cause of completion delays is the failure to discharge pre-commencement planning conditions. We cannot emphasise this enough: begin the condition discharge process as soon as planning permission is granted, regardless of when you intend to apply for finance. A developer who receives planning permission in January and applies for finance in April should have most conditions discharged by the time the lender's solicitor begins due diligence, rather than starting the discharge process in May when the lender is ready to complete.",
          "The second most common delay is the building contract. Lenders' solicitors frequently raise queries about building contracts, particularly bespoke contracts or contracts that have been significantly amended from the standard JCT form. Using a standard <a href=\"/guides/jct-contracts-development-finance\">JCT contract</a> with minimal amendments reduces the scope for queries and speeds up the review process. If amendments are necessary, discuss them with your solicitor and your broker before the facility offer is issued, so that the lender's solicitor can be briefed on the amendments in advance.",
          "Insurance is another common bottleneck. The lender will require specific insurance policies with specific endorsements, including contractor's all risks insurance, public liability insurance, employer's liability insurance, and professional indemnity insurance for the design team. Obtaining these policies, particularly with the lender noted as an interested party, can take two to four weeks. Instruct your insurance broker at the same time as you instruct your solicitor, and provide them with the lender's insurance requirements as soon as they are available. By anticipating and addressing these common delays, a well-prepared developer can achieve a completion timeline of four to six weeks from facility offer to first drawdown, compared to eight to twelve weeks for a developer who has not prepared."
