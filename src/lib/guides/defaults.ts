        content: [
          "A development loan default occurs when a borrower fails to meet one or more of the conditions set out in their facility agreement. While most people associate default with non-payment, in <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> the triggers are far broader and can include breaches of financial covenants, failure to meet build programme milestones, or even changes in the borrower's corporate structure without lender consent. In our experience arranging facilities from £500,000 to over £30,000,000, we have seen defaults triggered by circumstances that many developers simply did not anticipate when they signed their loan documentation.",
          "The distinction between a technical default and an actual payment default is critically important. A technical default means you have breached a term of the facility agreement but have not necessarily missed a payment. For example, if your loan-to-value ratio exceeds the agreed covenant threshold because property values have dropped, you are in technical default even though you are still making scheduled payments. An actual payment default occurs when you fail to repay the loan on its maturity date or miss a scheduled interest payment where applicable.",
          "Understanding this distinction matters because lenders respond differently to each scenario. Technical defaults are often curable — meaning the borrower can take corrective action within a specified period to remedy the breach. Payment defaults, particularly at maturity, are treated far more seriously and typically trigger the formal enforcement process much more quickly. We have seen lenders grant extensions of three to six months for technical defaults, whereas a maturity default where no credible repayment plan exists can move to enforcement within weeks.",

        heading: "The initial breach notice",
        content: [
          "When a lender identifies a default, the first formal step is issuing a breach notice or reservation of rights letter. This document notifies the borrower that the lender is aware of the breach, specifies which clause of the facility agreement has been breached, and outlines what remedial action the borrower must take. The notice will also state that the lender reserves the right to exercise all its rights and remedies under the loan documentation, including acceleration of the debt and enforcement of security.",
          "Receiving a breach notice is undeniably alarming, but it is not the same as enforcement. In our experience, the breach notice is often the opening of a negotiation rather than the beginning of the end. Lenders do not want to take possession of half-built developments — the costs and complexities of completing a construction project are substantial, and the outcome is uncertain. A lender would far rather the borrower resolve the issue and repay the facility in the ordinary course.",
          "The critical mistake many developers make at this stage is failing to respond promptly and transparently. If you receive a breach notice, you should engage your solicitor immediately and prepare a detailed response that acknowledges the breach, explains the circumstances, and proposes a realistic remediation plan. We have seen developers who responded within forty-eight hours with a credible plan secure a three-month standstill agreement, while those who buried their heads found the lender appointing receivers within weeks.",
          "It is also worth noting that many facility agreements contain cure periods for certain defaults. A typical cure period might be fifteen to thirty business days for a financial covenant breach, during which the borrower can remedy the default without the lender taking further action. Check your facility agreement carefully — your solicitor should have flagged these provisions at the time of drawdown.",

        content: [
          "If the default is not remedied within the cure period, or if the breach is of a type that is not curable, the lender may choose to accelerate the facility. Acceleration means that the entire outstanding debt — principal, rolled-up interest, fees, and any default interest — becomes immediately due and payable. For a typical development facility of £2,000,000 to £5,000,000, the acceleration notice can represent a demand for the full amount plus penalties that may add £50,000 to £150,000 in default interest and fees.",
          "Default interest is charged at a significantly higher rate than the standard facility rate — typically two to four percentage points above the agreed rate. On a £3,000,000 facility at 8% per annum, default interest at 12% adds approximately £10,000 per month to the outstanding balance. These costs mount rapidly and can erode the equity in the project within a matter of months. This is why early action is so important, as we explain in our guide on <a href=\"/guides/avoiding-default-development-finance\">avoiding default on development finance</a>.",
          "At this stage, the borrower has limited options: repay the debt in full, negotiate a standstill or forbearance agreement with the lender, or find alternative finance to refinance the facility before enforcement action begins. If you are in this position, <a href=\"/deal-room\">contact our deal room</a> urgently — we have relationships with specialist lenders who can provide rescue finance to developers facing enforcement, though terms will reflect the distressed nature of the situation.",

        heading: "Enforcement: LPA receivers and possession",
        content: [
          "If the borrower cannot repay the accelerated debt or reach an agreement with the lender, enforcement proceedings begin. The most common enforcement mechanism in development finance is the appointment of a Law of Property Act (LPA) receiver. An LPA receiver is appointed by the lender under powers contained in the mortgage deed and the Law of Property Act 1925. The receiver takes control of the property and manages it with the primary objective of recovering the lender's debt.",
          "The appointment of an LPA receiver is a significant event. The receiver effectively takes over the development — they can complete construction works, market and sell units, or dispose of the site as they see fit, provided their actions are directed towards repaying the lender. The borrower loses practical control of the project, although technically the receiver acts as agent of the borrower, not the lender. This agency structure means the borrower remains liable for the receiver's costs and any shortfall on the debt.",
          "In our experience, receiver-managed completions are costly and time-consuming. The receiver will need to appoint new contractors (the original contractor will often have walked off site when they learn a receiver has been appointed), obtain fresh tenders, and manage the build programme without the developer's site knowledge. Receiver's fees typically range from £15,000 to £50,000 depending on the complexity of the project, and the total cost of completing and selling a development through a receivership can be twenty to thirty percent higher than the developer's original budget.",
          "For developers with multiple projects, a default on one facility can trigger cross-default clauses in other facility agreements. This means that a default on your £1,500,000 scheme in <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">Surrey</a> could technically constitute a default on your £4,000,000 facility in Greater London. Cross-default provisions are one of the most dangerous clauses in development finance, and we always advise developers to understand their cross-default exposure across all facilities.",

      {
        heading: "The role of personal guarantees in default",
        content: [
          "Most development finance facilities include a personal guarantee from the directors or shareholders of the borrowing entity. When a loan defaults and enforcement proceeds, the personal guarantee becomes a live liability. If the sale of the development does not generate sufficient proceeds to repay the lender in full, the lender will pursue the guarantor personally for the shortfall. This can mean the loss of personal assets including your home, savings, and other investments.",
          "The scope of a personal guarantee varies significantly between lenders. Some guarantees are limited to a specific pound amount — for example, twenty percent of the facility, which on a £3,000,000 loan would cap your personal exposure at £600,000. Others are unlimited, meaning the guarantor is liable for the entire shortfall plus all enforcement costs, legal fees, and default interest. We always advise developers to negotiate the scope of their personal guarantee before signing — read our detailed guide on <a href=\"/guides/personal-guarantees-development-finance\">personal guarantees in development finance</a> for more information.",
          "In practice, lenders do not always pursue personal guarantees immediately or aggressively. The cost and uncertainty of litigation means that many lenders will negotiate a settlement with the guarantor for less than the full shortfall amount, particularly if the guarantor engages proactively and provides full financial disclosure. However, this is not guaranteed, and some lenders — particularly those backed by institutional capital with strict recovery mandates — will pursue guarantees through the courts. We have seen guarantors face county court judgments, charging orders on their homes, and in extreme cases, bankruptcy petitions.",

        heading: "Protecting your position during default",
        content: [
          "If you are facing a potential default, the single most important step is to communicate early and honestly with your lender. Lenders are far more likely to work with a borrower who approaches them before a default crystallises than one who waits until after enforcement notices have been served. In our experience, proactive communication has saved developers from enforcement in the majority of cases we have been involved with.",
          "Engage a specialist solicitor with experience in development finance defaults — not your conveyancing solicitor or general commercial lawyer. Development finance enforcement involves complex interactions between security documents, planning permissions, building contracts, and sometimes intercreditor agreements with mezzanine lenders. A specialist will understand the lender's position and can negotiate effectively on your behalf. Expect to pay £5,000 to £15,000 in legal fees for specialist default advice, but this is a fraction of the cost of an uncontested receivership.",
          "Consider whether refinancing is possible. Even in a default scenario, there are specialist lenders who will refinance distressed developments — typically at rates of twelve to eighteen percent per annum with arrangement fees of two to three percent, but this may be significantly cheaper than the alternative of receivership and personal guarantee enforcement. The key requirement is that the underlying development must have sufficient value to support the new facility, and there must be a credible completion and exit strategy.",
          "Finally, document everything. Keep records of all communications with the lender, all site progress, all expenditure, and all professional advice received. If the matter proceeds to litigation or a dispute about the lender's conduct, contemporaneous documentation is invaluable. Developers who maintain meticulous records are in a far stronger negotiating position than those who rely on memory and informal communications.",

        heading: "Timeline of a typical development loan default",
        content: [
          "Understanding the typical timeline of a development loan default helps developers plan their response. While every case is different, the general pattern is remarkably consistent. Day one: the default event occurs — this might be the maturity date passing without repayment, or the monitoring surveyor reporting that the project is significantly behind programme. Days one to five: the lender's credit team reviews the situation and instructs their legal team. Days five to fifteen: the breach notice or reservation of rights letter is issued to the borrower. Days fifteen to forty-five: the cure period runs, during which the borrower must remedy the default or propose a solution.",
          "If the default is not remedied, the lender will typically issue an acceleration notice around day forty-five to sixty. The borrower then has a short period — usually fourteen days — to repay the accelerated debt. If repayment is not made, the lender will move to appoint an LPA receiver, which can happen as quickly as day seventy-five to ninety from the original default event. In practice, the timeline is often extended by negotiations, particularly where the borrower engages constructively and the lender sees a realistic path to recovery.",
          "However, we have also seen cases where lenders have moved from default to receiver appointment in as little as thirty days, particularly where the lender suspects the borrower is dissipating assets or where the development is deteriorating without active management. The speed of enforcement depends on the lender's appetite for negotiation, the severity of the default, and the lender's assessment of the risk to their security.",

          "A Law of Property Act (LPA) receiver is a professional appointed by a secured lender under powers granted by Section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925 and the terms of the mortgage deed. In the context of <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a>, an LPA receiver is typically appointed when the borrower has defaulted on the loan and the lender wishes to take control of the development to protect and recover its security. The receiver is usually a licensed insolvency practitioner or a chartered surveyor with experience in managing distressed property assets.",
          "The critical legal point about LPA receivers is that they act as agent of the borrower, not the lender. This agency relationship, established by Section 109(2) of the Law of Property Act 1925, means that the borrower — not the lender — is liable for the receiver's actions, fees, and any liabilities incurred during the receivership. This structure was designed to protect lenders from liability, and it has significant implications for developers whose projects are placed into receivership.",
          "LPA receivership is distinct from administrative receivership and administration, which are governed by the Insolvency Act 1986. LPA receivership specifically relates to the recovery of secured property and does not require a court order. The lender can appoint an LPA receiver simply by executing a deed of appointment, provided the conditions in the mortgage deed and the Law of Property Act have been met. This makes LPA receivership a fast and relatively inexpensive enforcement mechanism for lenders, which is why it is the preferred route in development finance defaults.",

      {
        heading: "When and how LPA receivers are appointed",
        content: [
          "An LPA receiver can be appointed once the mortgage money has become due — which in development finance typically means after the facility has been accelerated following a default event. The statutory conditions for appointment are set out in Section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925, but most modern mortgage deeds expand these powers significantly, allowing appointment in a wider range of circumstances including breach of covenant, insolvency of the borrower, or material deterioration of the security.",
          "The appointment process is straightforward from the lender's perspective. The lender's solicitors prepare a deed of appointment, which is executed by the lender (or its authorised representative) and the proposed receiver. Notice of the appointment is then given to the borrower and registered at the Land Registry. The entire process can be completed within a matter of days, and we have seen appointments executed within forty-eight hours of the lender's decision to enforce.",
          "The borrower has limited grounds to challenge the appointment of an LPA receiver. The main challenges arise where the conditions for appointment have not been properly met — for example, if the lender failed to serve a valid demand notice or if the mortgage deed does not confer the power to appoint. In practice, successful challenges are rare because lender solicitors are experienced in ensuring the appointment process is properly executed. If you believe an appointment is invalid, seek specialist legal advice immediately, but be prepared for the reality that most challenges fail.",
          "In our experience of working with developers across the UK, the decision to appoint an LPA receiver is rarely taken lightly by lenders. The typical pattern is that the lender will have made multiple attempts to resolve the default through negotiation before resorting to enforcement. Where we have seen rapid appointments, it has usually been in situations where the lender has lost confidence in the borrower's ability or willingness to complete the project, or where the development is at risk of physical deterioration. For more on the overall default process, see our guide on <a href=\"/guides/what-happens-when-development-loan-defaults\">what happens when a development loan defaults</a>.",

          "Once appointed, the LPA receiver has extensive powers over the development. The statutory powers under Section 109 of the Law of Property Act include the power to demand and recover income from the property, to insure the property, and to manage and maintain the property. However, most modern mortgage deeds confer significantly wider powers, including the power to complete construction works, enter into contracts, market and sell the property, and take any action the receiver considers necessary or desirable to preserve or enhance the value of the security.",
          "In a development finance context, the receiver's powers effectively allow them to step into the developer's shoes and complete the project. This means the receiver can appoint new contractors, negotiate with planning authorities, instruct sales agents, and manage the day-to-day operation of the development site. The receiver will typically carry out a thorough review of the project within the first week of appointment, assessing the state of construction, the remaining budget, the planning position, and the likely exit value.",
          "The receiver owes duties to the borrower as well as the lender, but these duties are limited. The primary duty is to act in good faith and to obtain a proper price when selling the property — meaning the receiver must take reasonable steps to achieve market value. The receiver does not have a duty to maximise the return for the borrower; rather, the duty is to recover the lender's debt efficiently. This means the receiver may choose to sell the development at a stage or price that the developer considers suboptimal, provided the sale is conducted properly and achieves a reasonable price in the circumstances.",
          "Receiver's fees are a significant cost that the borrower must bear. LPA receivers typically charge between £250 and £500 per hour, and a receivership of a development project can easily generate fees of £25,000 to £75,000 depending on the complexity and duration. These fees rank ahead of the borrower's equity, meaning they are paid from the sale proceeds before any surplus is returned to the borrower. When combined with the lender's legal costs, default interest, and the typically reduced sale price achieved on a distressed asset, the total cost of receivership can consume most or all of the developer's equity in the project.",

          "The appointment of an LPA receiver has immediate and significant practical consequences for the development. Existing building contracts may be terminated or suspended — most JCT and bespoke building contracts contain provisions allowing either party to terminate upon the appointment of a receiver over the employer. This means the main contractor will typically down tools, and the receiver must negotiate new arrangements to continue the build, often at significantly higher cost.",
          "The supply chain is similarly disrupted. Subcontractors and material suppliers who are owed money by the developer will have unsecured claims that are unlikely to be paid in full during the receivership. New suppliers will require payment terms that reflect the receivership status, which usually means payment on delivery or shorter credit terms. The receiver will also need to establish whether any plant or equipment on site is owned, hired, or subject to retention of title claims, which can further delay the restart of construction works.",
          "We have seen receivership add between six and eighteen months to the completion timeline of a development, depending on the stage of construction at the time of appointment. A development that was at first fix stage might take twelve months to complete under a receiver, compared to six months under the original developer. The additional time, combined with higher construction costs and receiver's fees, can transform a profitable development into one that delivers no return — or even a shortfall — for the borrower.",
          "Planning permissions and building regulations approvals are not directly affected by the appointment of a receiver, but practical complications can arise. If the planning permission is subject to conditions that require action within specific timeframes, the receiver must ensure compliance. Similarly, any <a href=\"/guides/planning-refusal-development-finance\">planning obligations or Section 106 agreements</a> transfer with the land and must be honoured. The receiver will typically instruct a planning consultant to review the planning position as part of their initial assessment of the project.",

The developer can cooperate with the receiver to achieve the best possible outcome — providing information about the project, introductions to contractors and consultants, and practical assistance that can help the receiver complete and sell the development more efficiently. A cooperative approach can reduce receiver's fees and improve the overall outcome for all parties.",
          "The developer should also seek independent legal advice immediately upon learning of the appointment. A specialist solicitor can review the validity of the appointment, assess whether the lender has complied with all procedural requirements, and advise on the developer's rights during the receivership. If the receiver subsequently sells the property at an undervalue, the developer may have a claim against the receiver or the lender, although such claims are difficult and expensive to pursue.",
          "If there is a mezzanine lender or other secured creditor involved in the capital structure, the developer should understand how the <a href=\"/guides/intercreditor-agreements-explained\">intercreditor agreement</a> affects the receivership. The mezzanine lender may have rights to cure the senior default, step into the senior lender's position, or participate in the enforcement process. In some cases, the mezzanine lender can provide additional funding to the receiver to complete the development, which may improve the overall recovery and potentially preserve some value for the developer.",
          "Finally, the developer should carefully monitor the receiver's conduct throughout the receivership. The receiver must account for all income and expenditure, and the developer is entitled to receive accounts of the receivership. If the developer believes the receiver is not acting in good faith or is failing to obtain proper value for the property, this should be raised formally — first with the receiver directly, then through legal proceedings if necessary.

The direct costs include the receiver's professional fees (typically £25,000 to £75,000), the lender's legal costs for the enforcement process (£10,000 to £30,000), and default interest on the outstanding loan balance. On a £3,500,000 facility, default interest at an additional three percent per annum adds approximately £8,750 per month to the debt.",
          "Indirect costs are equally significant. The disruption to the build programme means construction costs will increase — we typically see a fifteen to twenty-five percent uplift on the remaining build budget when a receiver takes over mid-construction. This is due to the need to re-tender works, mobilise new contractors, and deal with the practical consequences of a site that has been dormant for several weeks or months. Professional fees for quantity surveyors, architects, and project managers engaged by the receiver add further to the cost.",
          "The combined effect of these costs is that receivership can consume £100,000 to £500,000 or more of the development's value, depending on the size and complexity of the project. For smaller schemes — those with a GDV under £2,000,000 — the costs of receivership can represent such a large proportion of the total value that there is little or no prospect of any surplus being returned to the borrower after the lender's debt is repaid.

The most common alternative is a consensual sale, where the borrower agrees to sell the development (either in its current state or upon completion) and use the proceeds to repay the lender. A consensual sale avoids the costs and disruption of receivership and typically achieves a higher price because the property is not marketed as a distressed or receiver-managed asset.",
          "Another alternative is refinancing with a specialist lender. Even when a default has occurred, there are lenders on our panel who will provide rescue finance to repay the defaulting facility and allow the developer to complete the project. The terms will be expensive — typically twelve to eighteen percent interest with arrangement fees of two to three percent — but the total cost is often significantly less than receivership. The key requirement is that the development must have sufficient value to support the new lending, and the developer must have a credible plan for completion.",
          "In some cases, the lender and borrower can agree a standstill or forbearance arrangement, under which the lender agrees not to enforce for a specified period while the borrower takes steps to remedy the default. Standstill agreements are particularly useful where the default is temporary — for example, where sales have stalled but the market is expected to recover, or where a contractor has become insolvent but a replacement can be appointed quickly.

          "What makes development finance particularly susceptible to default is its short-term nature and the complexity of the underlying activity. A <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance facility</a> is typically twelve to twenty-four months in duration, during which time the borrower must acquire a site, complete construction, and either sell or refinance the completed units. Any disruption to this tightly sequenced programme — whether from planning delays, contractor problems, supply chain issues, or market conditions — can cascade through the project timeline and ultimately threaten the facility's repayment.",
          "The developers who avoid default are those who plan for problems before they arise. This means building genuine contingency into the budget (not the minimum five percent that lenders require, but ten to fifteen percent for complex or unfamiliar schemes), programming realistic build timescales that account for weather, supply chain delays, and the inevitable surprises that construction throws up, and maintaining a financial buffer that allows the project to absorb unexpected costs without immediately threatening the facility covenants.",

          "The first warning sign is typically a divergence between the planned and actual build programme. If your project is two weeks behind at month three of an eighteen-month build, the natural instinct is to assume you will catch up. In our experience, early programme slippage almost always gets worse rather than better. A two-week delay at month three often becomes a two-month delay by month twelve, particularly if the delay is caused by systemic issues such as poor site management, subcontractor availability, or material supply problems. Monitor your programme rigorously and address slippage immediately.",
          "The second warning sign is cost escalation. If your quantity surveyor's interim valuation shows that costs are tracking above budget — even by a small margin — investigate the cause immediately. A five percent overrun on a £1,200,000 build budget represents £60,000, which may already have consumed most of your contingency. If costs are running ahead of programme (meaning you have spent more than expected relative to the work completed), this is an even more serious indicator that the total build cost will exceed the approved budget.",
          "The third warning sign relates to the exit strategy. If comparable sales values in your area are declining, if similar schemes are taking longer to sell than anticipated, or if your sales agent is recommending price reductions, these are signals that your exit strategy may not deliver the proceeds needed to repay the facility. Do not wait until units are on the market to discover that your GDV assumptions were optimistic — monitor the local market throughout the build programme and adjust your strategy accordingly. Understanding <a href=\"/guides/how-to-calculate-gdv\">how to calculate GDV</a> and keeping those figures current is essential.",
          "Other warning signs include deterioration in your relationship with the monitoring surveyor (who may be flagging concerns in their reports to the lender), difficulty in obtaining drawdowns (which may indicate the lender is becoming cautious), and personal financial stress that is distracting you from project management. Any of these should prompt immediate action.",

The financial contingency should be genuinely available (not committed to other purposes), and it should be sized appropriately for the risk profile of the project. For a straightforward new-build residential scheme using an established contractor, five to seven percent of build costs may be adequate. For a complex conversion, a heritage project, or a scheme with ground condition risks, ten to fifteen percent is more appropriate.",
          "Beyond financial contingency, effective risk management includes having alternative contractor arrangements in place. We have seen too many developments stall because the main contractor became insolvent or was removed from site, and the developer had no backup plan. Before starting on site, identify at least one alternative contractor who could step in at short notice. This does not require a formal contract — a preliminary conversation and indicative pricing is sufficient to give you options if the worst happens. Our guide on <a href=\"/guides/contractor-insolvency-development-finance\">contractor insolvency and development finance</a> covers this topic in detail.",
          "Your contingency strategy should also include a time buffer. If your facility has an eighteen-month term and your build programme shows completion at month fifteen, you have a three-month buffer. If completion is programmed at month seventeen, you have almost no margin for error. We always advise developers to structure their facility terms to provide at least three to six months of headroom beyond the programmed completion date. The cost of a slightly longer facility term is minimal compared to the cost of a maturity default.",
          "Finally, maintain open lines of communication with your lender or broker throughout the project. Regular updates — even when things are going well — build trust and credibility that will prove invaluable if problems arise later. A lender who receives monthly progress reports and knows the developer is on top of the project is far more likely to grant a term extension than one who only hears from the developer when things have gone wrong.",

Proactive relationship management means communicating regularly, transparently, and with supporting evidence.",

This level of reporting goes beyond what most lenders require, but it demonstrates professionalism and builds confidence.",

Do not wait until the monitoring surveyor discovers the issue on their next site visit. Contact the lender or your broker immediately, explain what has happened, quantify the impact on programme and budget, and present your proposed solution. Lenders respect developers who identify problems early and propose solutions, because it shows they are managing the project actively rather than hoping problems will resolve themselves.",

Breaching any of these covenants constitutes a default, even if the project is otherwise progressing well.",

Property values can change — we have seen developments where falling land values triggered an LTV covenant breach even though the build was on programme and on budget. Build cost inflation can push total costs above the LTC covenant threshold. And market softening can reduce the projected GDV, pushing the LTGDV above the agreed limit. Developers should recalculate their covenant metrics monthly and take action before a breach occurs.",

Request a covenant waiver or amendment, supported by evidence that the underlying project remains viable. For example, if property values have declined but you have strong pre-sales at the original projected prices, present this evidence to demonstrate that the GDV assumption remains achievable. Lenders are far more receptive to waiver requests that come with supporting evidence and a clear explanation than to breaches discovered by the monitoring surveyor.

This scenario is particularly common in markets that have softened since the facility was underwritten, or where the developer has not engaged a sales agent early enough to build a pipeline of reservations before practical completion.",
          "To avoid this scenario, engage your sales agent at least six months before anticipated completion — not after practical completion. A good agent will begin marketing off-plan, building a database of interested buyers, and potentially securing reservations before the first unit is ready for occupation. Off-plan reservations give you and your lender confidence that the exit strategy is achievable, and they can also support applications for <a href=\"/services#development-exit-finance\">development exit finance</a> if you need to refinance the development facility with a longer-term product.",
          "Have a backup exit strategy. If your primary strategy is individual unit sales, your backup might be a bulk sale to an investor or a refinance onto a buy-to-let portfolio. If your primary strategy is refinancing onto a commercial mortgage, ensure you have identified lenders who will provide the term facility and have obtained indicative terms. The backup strategy does not need to be as profitable as the primary strategy — it just needs to generate sufficient proceeds to repay the development facility and avoid default.",

        heading: "Why cost overruns threaten development finance facilities",
        content: [
          "Cost overruns are one of the most common triggers for development finance defaults in the UK. When build costs exceed the approved budget, the consequences ripple through the entire facility structure. The contingency budget is consumed first, but once that is exhausted, the developer must inject additional equity or find supplementary finance to complete the project. If neither is available, the development stalls — and a stalled development is every lender's worst nightmare, because the security (a partially completed building) is worth significantly less than either the land or the completed project.",
          "The mechanics of how cost overruns affect a <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance facility</a> are straightforward but severe. Most facilities are structured with a fixed build cost budget that has been verified by a quantity surveyor and agreed by the lender. The facility amount is calculated based on this budget — typically seventy to seventy-five percent of total costs. When actual costs exceed the budget, the borrower must fund the difference from their own resources. On a scheme with a £1,800,000 build budget and a ten percent overrun, the developer must find an additional £180,000 that was not in the original plan.",
          "Furthermore, cost overruns can trigger loan-to-cost covenant breaches. If the facility agreement caps the loan at seventy-five percent of total project costs, and total costs increase because of overruns, the borrower may breach this covenant even though they have not drawn any additional funds. The lender may then require the borrower to inject additional equity to restore the covenant ratio, placing further financial pressure on the developer. Understanding these dynamics is critical for anyone managing a development finance facility.",

        heading: "Common causes of cost overruns in UK construction",
        content: [
          "The most frequent cause of cost overruns in our experience is inadequate initial budgeting. Developers — particularly those early in their careers — often prepare build budgets based on the most optimistic assumptions: lowest tender prices, no allowance for variations, and minimal contingency. When the reality of construction hits — material price increases, unforeseen ground conditions, design changes required by building control — the budget is overwhelmed. We always advise developers to base their budgets on the median tender price rather than the lowest, and to include genuine contingency of seven to ten percent for standard schemes and up to fifteen percent for complex projects.",
          "Ground conditions are a persistent source of cost overruns, particularly in parts of the South East where clay soils, high water tables, and contaminated land are common. A site investigation that reveals unexpected ground conditions after construction has started can add £50,000 to £200,000 to foundation costs alone. Developers working in <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">Kent, Essex, and Greater London</a> should budget for comprehensive ground investigations before purchasing a site, even though the cost of £5,000 to £15,000 may seem significant at the feasibility stage.",
          "Material price volatility is another major factor, particularly since 2022 when supply chain disruptions caused dramatic increases in the cost of steel, timber, concrete, and insulation products. While prices have stabilised somewhat, they remain significantly above pre-pandemic levels and are subject to fluctuations driven by global supply and demand. Fixed-price building contracts provide some protection, but many contractors include price escalation clauses that allow them to pass on material cost increases above a specified threshold.",
          "Design changes during construction — whether initiated by the developer, required by building control, or necessitated by site conditions — are a further source of overruns. Every variation requires the architect to issue revised drawings, the quantity surveyor to price the change, and the contractor to adjust their programme and method. The direct cost of the variation is often compounded by delay costs and disruption claims from the contractor. The best way to minimise design changes is to invest in thorough pre-construction design development and to obtain building control pre-application advice before starting on site.",

      {
        heading: "Quantifying and reporting cost overruns",
        content: [
          "Early identification of cost overruns depends on rigorous financial monitoring throughout the construction phase. The developer should receive monthly cost reports from their quantity surveyor that compare actual expenditure against the approved budget, project the anticipated final cost, and highlight any variances. These reports should be shared with the lender or broker as part of the regular project reporting that we recommend in our guide on <a href=\"/guides/avoiding-default-development-finance\">avoiding default on development finance</a>.",
          "The key metric to monitor is the anticipated final cost — not just the expenditure to date. A project can appear to be on budget at the halfway point because the most expensive elements have not yet been completed. The quantity surveyor's role is to look ahead and project whether the remaining budget is sufficient to complete the works. If the projected final cost exceeds the approved budget, the overrun should be reported immediately, even if the current expenditure is within budget.",
          "When reporting a cost overrun to your lender, provide a detailed breakdown that shows: the original approved budget by trade or work package, the current anticipated final cost by the same breakdown, the variance for each element, and a clear explanation of the cause of each variance. Support the report with evidence — contractor correspondence, variation orders, ground investigation reports, or whatever documentation explains the cost increase. A lender who receives a well-documented cost report is far more likely to work constructively with the borrower than one who discovers the overrun through the monitoring surveyor's report.",
          "In our experience, the total quantum of the overrun matters less to lenders than the developer's awareness of and response to the issue. A developer who identifies a £150,000 overrun, explains the cause, and presents a funded plan to cover the additional cost will typically retain the lender's confidence. A developer who is unaware of a £50,000 overrun that the monitoring surveyor discovers will cause far more concern, because it suggests the project is not being properly managed.",

        heading: "Strategies for managing cost overruns",
        content: [
          "The first strategy is value engineering — reviewing the specification and design to identify cost savings that do not materially affect the quality or value of the completed development. Common value engineering measures include substituting specified materials with cost-effective alternatives (for example, engineered timber flooring instead of solid hardwood), simplifying the landscaping specification, or revising the kitchen and bathroom specifications. On a typical residential development, value engineering can recover three to eight percent of build costs, which may be sufficient to absorb a moderate overrun.",
          "The second strategy is to negotiate with your contractor. If the overrun is partly attributable to contractor inefficiency or variations that the contractor has priced aggressively, there may be scope to negotiate reduced rates or a revised lump sum. This approach requires a good relationship with the contractor and a willingness to compromise — for example, accepting a slightly later completion date in exchange for reduced variation costs. The developer's quantity surveyor should lead these negotiations with detailed cost analysis to support the developer's position.",
          "The third strategy is to seek additional finance. If the overrun cannot be absorbed through value engineering or contractor negotiations, the developer may need to inject additional equity or arrange supplementary finance. <a href=\"/services#mezzanine-finance\">Mezzanine finance</a> can be used to bridge the gap between the senior facility and the total project cost, although arranging mezzanine finance mid-construction is more complex and expensive than at the outset. Alternatively, a topped-up facility from the existing lender or a replacement lender may be available if the development still demonstrates adequate profitability.",
          "The fourth strategy is to re-evaluate the exit strategy. If cost overruns have eroded the project's profitability, it may be necessary to adjust selling prices upward (if the market supports it), consider retaining some units as rental stock rather than selling (which may allow you to refinance onto a longer-term product), or accelerate the sales programme to generate early receipts. The appropriate strategy depends on the specific circumstances of the project and the local market conditions. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Contact our deal room</a> for tailored advice on managing cost overruns on your specific facility.",

        heading: "Negotiating with your lender after a cost overrun",
        content: [
          "When a cost overrun is identified, the developer must decide how to approach the lender. The starting point is to understand the lender's perspective. The lender's primary concern is whether the facility will be repaid — which depends on the development being completed to a standard and specification that achieves the projected GDV, within a timeframe that allows repayment before or at maturity. If the cost overrun does not threaten the project's viability and the developer can fund the additional costs, the lender may require nothing more than an updated development appraisal and confirmation that additional equity is available.",
          "However, if the cost overrun requires changes to the facility — such as an increase in the facility amount, an extension of the term, or a waiver of a financial covenant — the negotiation becomes more complex. The lender will want to understand why the overrun occurred, whether further overruns are likely, and what assurances the developer can provide that the project will still be completed successfully. Be prepared to provide updated QS reports, contractor correspondence, a revised development appraisal, and evidence of available equity or supplementary funding.",
          "In our experience, lenders are most receptive to facility amendments where the developer has identified the problem early, has a credible plan to resolve it, and is contributing additional equity. A request for a £200,000 facility increase supported by evidence that the developer is injecting £100,000 of additional equity demonstrates shared commitment and is much more likely to be approved than a request for the lender to absorb the entire additional cost. The negotiation process typically takes two to four weeks, during which time the developer should continue progressing the build to maintain momentum and demonstrate commitment.",

        heading: "Contractual protections against cost overruns",
        content: [
          "The most effective protection against cost overruns is a well-structured building contract. A fixed-price lump sum contract (such as JCT Design and Build 2024) transfers the majority of construction cost risk to the contractor, subject to variations instructed by the employer and certain defined circumstances such as unforeseeable ground conditions. While no contract eliminates cost risk entirely, a lump sum contract provides a ceiling on the base build cost that the developer can rely on for budgeting purposes.",
          "Performance bonds and parent company guarantees provide additional protection. A performance bond — typically ten percent of the contract value, costing the developer £3,000 to £8,000 — provides a financial guarantee that the contractor will complete the works. If the contractor defaults, the bond pays out to cover the additional costs of appointing an alternative contractor. A parent company guarantee, where available, provides a direct claim against the contractor's parent company if the contracting entity fails to perform.",
          "Developers should also consider professional indemnity insurance for their design team. If cost overruns are caused by design errors — for example, an architect's failure to identify a structural issue that requires expensive remedial works — the design team's professional indemnity insurance may cover the additional costs. Ensure your design team carries adequate PI cover (typically a minimum of £1,000,000 per claim for residential developments) and that the cover is on an each and every claim basis rather than aggregate.",
          "Finally, ensure your development appraisal includes a realistic contingency that is genuinely uncommitted. We have seen too many appraisals where the contingency is nominally five percent but has already been mentally allocated to known cost items that the developer has excluded from the base budget. A genuine contingency is money that the developer expects not to spend — and is available to absorb the unexpected costs that inevitably arise in construction.

A developer in Surrey was building a scheme of eight houses with a GDV of £5,600,000 and a total project cost of £3,800,000. The development finance facility was £2,700,000, and the developer had contributed £1,100,000 of equity. The build budget was £2,200,000 with a £110,000 contingency (five percent).",
          "At month eight of an eighteen-month build programme, the quantity surveyor identified that costs were tracking twelve percent above budget — an overrun of £264,000. The causes were a combination of ground conditions requiring additional piling (£95,000), material price increases on timber frame and insulation (£82,000), and variations required by building control to meet updated thermal efficiency standards (£87,000). The contingency was already largely consumed by minor variations earlier in the build.",
          "The developer approached us immediately. We prepared a comprehensive package for the lender showing the cause and quantum of the overrun, a revised development appraisal demonstrating that the project remained viable with a revised profit of fifteen percent on GDV (down from the original twenty-two percent), and evidence that the developer could inject £130,000 of additional equity. We also presented an application for a £134,000 facility increase. The lender approved both the additional equity injection and the facility increase within three weeks, and the development completed on a revised programme without further issues. The key factors in this positive outcome were early identification, transparent communication, and the developer's willingness to share the additional cost burden with the lender.",

Unlike cost overruns, which can sometimes be absorbed through additional equity or value engineering, programme delays have a direct and unavoidable impact on the facility's repayment timeline. If the build takes longer than planned, completion is delayed; if completion is delayed, the exit strategy (whether sales or refinancing) cannot commence; and if the exit strategy cannot commence, the facility cannot be repaid on time.",
          "In our experience, programme delays of three to six months are common across all types of development projects. The causes are varied: adverse weather, subcontractor availability, material delivery delays, planning condition discharge timescales, building control inspection delays, and service connection lead times. Many of these are outside the developer's direct control, but all of them are foreseeable risks that should be accounted for in the original programme. The developers who avoid maturity default are those who build realistic programmes from the outset and monitor progress rigorously.",
          "The financial impact of programme delays extends beyond the maturity date issue. Every additional month of construction adds to the rolled-up interest on the facility — at an interest rate of nine percent per annum on a £2,500,000 facility, each month of delay adds approximately £18,750 to the total debt. Over a six-month delay, this amounts to £112,500 of additional interest, which directly reduces the developer's profit margin and can push a marginal scheme into loss territory.",

A development starting groundworks in November in the Midlands should programme for significantly more weather downtime than one starting in April. Yet we regularly see programmes that assume the same productivity rates regardless of the season.",
          "Subcontractor availability is an increasingly significant cause of delays, particularly in regions with high levels of construction activity such as <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">Greater London</a> and the wider South East. Specialist trades — bricklayers, roofers, electricians, and plumbers — are in high demand, and a subcontractor who commits to a start date may delay by several weeks if a more profitable or convenient job becomes available. The developer's main contractor should manage subcontractor coordination, but the developer should monitor progress against programme and escalate delays early.",

Discharging planning conditions, obtaining building control sign-off, securing utility connections, and completing Section 278 highway works agreements all have lead times that can extend to several months. We have seen developments delayed by eight to twelve weeks waiting for a water connection or an electricity supply, even though the application was submitted months in advance. Developers should identify all regulatory and utility requirements at the earliest stage and programme lead times based on current processing times, not optimistic assumptions.",
          "Design changes and variation instructions during construction are a further source of delay. Every change requires the design team to issue revised drawings, the contractor to re-programme and re-price the affected works, and potentially a new building control submission. The cumulative effect of multiple small changes can be as significant as a single major variation. The best strategy is to freeze the design before construction starts and resist the temptation to make changes during the build unless they are essential.",

          "The golden rule is to notify your lender or broker as soon as you identify that the programme is materially delayed — meaning the delay will affect the facility's repayment timeline. Do not wait until the delay is certain; notify when it is probable. A developer who contacts their lender at month six saying \"we have identified a potential three-month delay and here is our plan to mitigate it\" will receive a very different response from one who contacts the lender at month seventeen (one month before maturity) saying \"we need a three-month extension.\"",
          "The notification should be in writing and should include: a summary of the current programme position, the cause of the delay, the expected impact on the completion date, a revised programme showing the new anticipated completion date, and any mitigating measures the developer is taking. If the delay will affect the exit strategy timeline, include a revised exit strategy timeline as well. Supporting the notification with an updated monitoring surveyor's report adds credibility.",
          "In our experience working with lenders across the UK market, the tone and content of the notification matter significantly. Present the delay as a managed issue that you are addressing proactively, not as a crisis that you are unable to control. Lenders are looking for evidence that the developer understands the problem, has a realistic plan to manage it, and is taking active steps to minimise the impact. If you can demonstrate that you are recovering time through acceleration measures (additional labour, extended working hours, revised construction sequence), this further strengthens your position.",
          "We also recommend having your broker make the initial approach to the lender where possible. As intermediaries, we can frame the issue in terms the lender's credit team will respond to positively, and we can manage the subsequent discussions to achieve the best possible outcome. Many of the term extensions and covenant waivers we have negotiated started with a carefully crafted notification that set the right tone for the discussion. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Contact our deal room</a> if you need assistance with lender communications.",

          "Most development finance lenders have provisions within their facility agreements that allow for term extensions, subject to lender approval and the payment of an extension fee. A typical extension fee is 0.25% to 1% of the outstanding facility amount per month of extension. On a £3,000,000 facility, a three-month extension at 0.5% per month costs £45,000 in extension fees, in addition to the continued accrual of interest at the facility rate (or a higher rate if specified for the extension period).",
          "To maximise your chances of securing a term extension, prepare a comprehensive extension application that demonstrates: the development will be completed within the extended term (support this with a revised programme endorsed by your contractor and monitoring surveyor), the exit strategy remains achievable within the extended timeline (support this with current market evidence and, where possible, evidence of buyer interest or pre-sales), all covenants will continue to be complied with during the extended period, and the developer has the financial resources to fund the extension costs and any remaining construction costs.",
          "Some lenders will decline to extend and instead require the borrower to refinance with an alternative lender. This is particularly common with lenders who have strict fund mandates or who have become uncomfortable with the project's risk profile. If your lender declines an extension, do not panic — <a href=\"/services#development-exit-finance\">development exit finance</a> is specifically designed for situations where the build is complete or near-complete but the exit has not yet been achieved. We can typically arrange development exit finance within two to four weeks, which may be sufficient to avoid a maturity default.",

Evaluate these conditions carefully with your solicitor and broker. While additional conditions are not ideal, they are almost always preferable to the alternative of default and enforcement.",

Common acceleration measures include: increasing the labour force on site, extending working hours (subject to planning conditions and noise restrictions), working weekends and bank holidays, re-sequencing works to allow parallel activities, and using off-site fabrication or pre-manufactured components to reduce on-site construction time.",
          "Acceleration costs money. Additional labour, overtime rates, and weekend working premiums can increase the build cost by five to fifteen percent for the accelerated works packages. The developer must weigh the cost of acceleration against the cost of delay — specifically, the continued accrual of interest on the facility, the risk of a maturity default, and any extension fees that would otherwise be payable. In many cases, spending an additional £30,000 to £50,000 on acceleration is significantly cheaper than the £100,000 or more in additional interest, fees, and potential enforcement costs that a three-month delay would generate.",
          "Not all delays can be recovered through acceleration. If the delay is caused by a critical path item — for example, a bespoke structural steel order with a twelve-week lead time — no amount of additional labour will recover the lost time. In these cases, the developer should focus on identifying parallel activities that can proceed while the critical path item is awaited, and on ensuring that the remainder of the programme is as efficient as possible. A construction programme consultant can review the programme and identify opportunities for time savings that may not be apparent to the developer or main contractor.",
          "If acceleration is not feasible or cost-effective, the developer should accept the delay, revise the programme realistically, and focus on negotiating appropriate terms with the lender. As discussed in the previous section, a well-prepared extension application supported by a realistic revised programme is far more likely to succeed than an unrealistic promise to recover time that cannot be recovered. Lenders see through optimistic promises and will lose confidence if the developer repeatedly misses revised target dates.",

          "A programme delay of three to six months may seem manageable during the construction phase, but its impact on the exit strategy can be disproportionate. For residential developments relying on individual unit sales, a delay in completion means a delay in obtaining practical completion certificates, a delay in marketing completed units (as opposed to off-plan), and a delay in exchanging and completing sales. The typical timeline from practical completion to the last unit selling is three to nine months, so a three-month construction delay can push the final exit twelve months beyond the original plan.",
          "The timing of completion can also affect sales values. Completing in autumn or winter in the UK typically means fewer viewings, longer marketing periods, and potentially lower prices than completing in spring or summer. We have seen developments where a three-month delay that moved completion from March to June had minimal impact on sales, while the same three-month delay moving completion from September to December added two months to the average sales period.",
          "For developments where the exit strategy is refinancing onto a <a href=\"/services#commercial-mortgages\">commercial mortgage</a> or investment product, the delay impacts the refinance application timeline. Most term lenders require the property to be complete, let, and producing rental income before they will complete a refinance. A construction delay therefore delays the start of the letting process, which in turn delays the refinance. The developer must fund the facility interest during this extended period, which can be substantial.",
          "To mitigate the impact of programme delays on the exit strategy, consider whether any elements of the exit can be brought forward. Can units be marketed for off-plan sale before practical completion? Can commercial tenants be offered pre-let agreements? Can the refinance lender provide indicative terms and begin their valuation process before completion, so that the refinance can complete quickly after practical completion? These measures require proactive planning and coordination but can significantly reduce the gap between completion and exit.

          "The most important lesson from our experience with programme delays is that realistic programming at the outset prevents most problems. A programme that includes adequate float for weather, regulatory delays, and unforeseen issues is far more likely to be achievable than one optimised for the shortest possible duration. We advise developers to add a minimum of fifteen to twenty percent to the contractor's proposed programme duration as a management buffer, and to structure the facility term to accommodate this buffer.",
          "The second lesson is that monitoring must be regular and rigorous. A monthly programme review that compares actual progress against the planned programme, identifies variances, and assesses the impact on the completion date is essential. This review should involve the developer, the project manager, and the main contractor, and the outcomes should be documented and shared with the lender or broker. The cost of a monthly programme review meeting is negligible compared to the cost of a programme delay that is identified too late to manage.",
          "The third lesson is that communication with the lender should be ongoing and transparent. The lenders who are most willing to accommodate programme delays are those who have been kept informed throughout the project and who trust the developer's reporting. A lender who receives regular updates, site photographs, and programme reports is far more likely to grant a term extension than one who has had no contact with the borrower since drawdown. If you are managing a development project with finance in place, make lender communication a priority — it is one of the most effective risk management tools available to you.",

In the UK market, development exit finance has become an increasingly important tool for developers navigating slower sales markets, and it represents one of the most effective strategies for avoiding default on a development loan.",
          "The product works by replacing the existing development finance facility with a new, typically shorter-term loan secured against the completed development. Because the construction risk has been eliminated (the building is finished), the lending risk is primarily a sales or valuation risk, which means development exit lenders can often offer more competitive terms than the development finance facility they are replacing. Interest rates for development exit finance typically start from around 0.55% per month (6.6% per annum) for strong propositions, rising to 0.85% per month (10.2% per annum) for more complex situations.",
          "The key distinction between development exit finance and the original development facility is timing and purpose. Development finance funds the construction phase; development exit finance funds the sales or letting phase. By separating these two phases, the developer avoids the situation where a facility designed for construction (with its stricter covenants and higher monitoring requirements) is being used to fund what is essentially a sales period. Development exit lenders understand that sales take time and structure their facilities accordingly, with terms of six to twenty-four months and more flexible repayment mechanisms.",

          "The optimal time to consider development exit finance is before your development facility reaches maturity — ideally three to six months before the maturity date. If your build is complete but you have not yet sold sufficient units to repay the development loan, development exit finance allows you to repay the existing facility on time (avoiding default interest and enforcement) and gives you a structured period to complete the sales programme at a pace that maximises value rather than one dictated by the urgency of an approaching maturity date.",
          "We also arrange development exit finance for developers whose builds are ninety percent or more complete, where the remaining works are minor (snagging, landscaping, fit-out of common areas) and do not represent significant construction risk. This allows the development facility to be repaid before maturity, with the final works completed under the exit facility. Some development exit lenders will hold back a small retention (typically five to ten percent of the facility) to cover the cost of completing minor outstanding works.",
          "The trigger for considering development exit finance should be your assessment of whether the development facility will be repaid from sales proceeds before maturity. If the answer is \"probably not\" or \"definitely not,\" act immediately. Do not wait until the maturity date is weeks away — the application and completion process for development exit finance typically takes three to six weeks, and rushing the process can result in suboptimal terms or, worse, a gap between the maturity of the old facility and the drawdown of the new one. In our experience, developers who plan their exit finance six months ahead achieve materially better terms than those who come to us as an emergency.",
          "You should also consider development exit finance if your development lender has indicated that they are unwilling to extend the facility term. Some lenders have strict fund mandates that do not permit extensions, and others may have lost confidence in the project's sales prospects. In either case, arranging development exit finance with a new lender allows you to repay the existing facility on time and avoid the default consequences we describe in our guide on <a href=\"/guides/what-happens-when-development-loan-defaults\">what happens when a development loan defaults</a>.",

        content: [
          "Development exit finance is typically structured as a single drawdown facility, with the entire loan amount advanced on completion to repay the existing development facility. The loan is secured by a first legal charge over the completed development (replacing the development finance lender's charge), and may also be supported by a personal guarantee from the developer, although some lenders offer non-recourse facilities for strong propositions.",
          "Loan-to-value ratios for development exit finance typically range from sixty-five to seventy-five percent of the current market value of the completed development, as determined by an independent RICS valuation. For a completed scheme valued at £4,000,000, a development exit lender offering seventy percent LTV would advance up to £2,800,000. If the outstanding development finance facility is £2,500,000, the development exit facility would repay this in full, with the remaining £300,000 available to cover the costs of the new facility (arrangement fees, legal fees, valuation) and provide working capital for the sales period.",
          "Interest is usually charged on a monthly basis at a rate between 0.55% and 0.85% per month, and can be either serviced (paid monthly) or rolled up (added to the loan balance). For developers who need to preserve cash flow during the sales period, rolled-up interest is typically preferred, although it increases the total cost of borrowing. Arrangement fees range from one to two percent of the loan amount, and legal costs are typically £3,000 to £8,000 depending on the complexity of the transaction.",
          "As units are sold, the net sale proceeds are used to reduce the development exit facility in a process known as sequential or partial release. The lender sets individual minimum release prices for each unit, below which the developer cannot sell without the lender's consent. These release prices are structured to ensure that the facility balance reduces proportionately (or preferably faster) as units are sold, so that the lender's LTV exposure is maintained or improved throughout the sales period.",

A development with two out of eight units already sold and strong comparable evidence supporting the asking prices will attract better terms than one with no sales and a declining local market.",
          "The application process typically involves submitting a summary of the development (number and type of units, current value, outstanding debt, sales status), the developer's track record and personal financial position, an exit strategy showing projected sales timeline and values, and supporting documentation including the existing facility agreement, latest monitoring surveyor report, and EPC certificates for the completed units. We prepare and present these packages on behalf of our clients to ensure they meet the specific requirements of each lender on our panel.",
          "Valuation is a critical part of the process. The development exit lender will instruct an independent RICS valuer to assess the current market value of the completed development — both as individual units and as a single lot (in case the lender needs to sell the entire development to a single purchaser). The valuation determines the maximum loan amount and is therefore the most important factor in the underwriting process. If the valuation comes in below the developer's expectations, the available facility may not be sufficient to repay the existing development loan in full, and the developer may need to inject additional equity to bridge the shortfall.",
          "In our experience, the most common reason development exit finance applications fail is a valuation shortfall. This can occur because the original GDV assumptions were optimistic, because the market has softened since the development finance was arranged, or because the valuer takes a conservative view of achievable prices. To mitigate this risk, we recommend obtaining an indicative valuation from a local RICS surveyor before formally applying for development exit finance. This costs £500 to £1,500 but can avoid the abortive costs and time wasted on an application that is unlikely to succeed. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Submit your project through our deal room</a> for an initial assessment of development exit finance availability.",

On a typical facility of £2,500,000 with a twelve-month term at 0.65% per month, the total interest cost if the facility runs to maturity would be approximately £195,000. Adding a 1.5% arrangement fee (£37,500) and legal and valuation costs of approximately £8,000, the total cost of the facility is around £240,500.",
          "This must be compared with the alternative of extending the existing development facility. A typical extension costs 0.25% to 1% per month of the outstanding balance, plus continued interest at the facility rate (which may increase during the extension period). On the same £2,500,000 facility at 9% per annum with a 0.5% monthly extension fee, a twelve-month extension would cost approximately £225,000 in interest plus £150,000 in extension fees, totalling £375,000. In this example, development exit finance is significantly cheaper than extending the development facility.",
          "However, the comparison is not always straightforward. If the existing development lender offers a short extension (three months) at a modest fee, and the developer is confident of selling sufficient units within that period, the extension may be more cost-effective than refinancing. The key variables are: the extension fee, the interest rate during the extension, the expected sales timeline, and the costs of arranging the alternative facility. We model these scenarios for our clients to help them make an informed decision.",
          "There is also a less tangible but important benefit of development exit finance: removing the stress and uncertainty of dealing with an increasingly impatient development lender. Once the development facility is repaid, the developer's relationship with the original lender is concluded, and they can focus on achieving the best possible sales outcome without the cloud of potential enforcement hanging over the project. This psychological benefit should not be underestimated, particularly for developers managing their first or second project.",

Residential developments (houses and flats for individual sale) attract the most competitive rates, with lenders comfortable at seventy to seventy-five percent LTV and rates from 0.55% per month. This reflects the relatively liquid nature of the residential sales market and the strong comparable evidence available for valuation purposes.",
          "Mixed-use developments (residential units over commercial ground floor space) are also eligible, although lenders may apply a blended approach — higher LTV and lower rates for the residential element, and lower LTV with higher rates for the commercial element. If the commercial space is pre-let to a tenant with a strong covenant, this significantly improves the terms available. An unlet commercial unit in a development exit finance structure is viewed as a higher risk by lenders.",

The terms reflect the typically longer void periods and less liquid disposal market for commercial property, with LTV ratios of sixty to sixty-five percent and rates from 0.75% per month being typical. The lender will want evidence of active marketing and indicative offers or terms from prospective tenants.",
          "For build-to-rent developments, the exit strategy is letting rather than selling, and the development exit facility bridges the period between completion and stabilised letting (typically six to twelve months). Once the development is fully let and producing rental income, it can be refinanced onto a long-term <a href=\"/services#commercial-mortgages\">commercial mortgage</a> or investment facility.

        content: [
          "Personal guarantees are a standard feature of almost every <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> facility in the UK. The reason is straightforward: development loans are typically advanced to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) — limited companies set up specifically for the project — which have no assets other than the development itself. If the project fails and the sale of the development does not generate sufficient proceeds to repay the loan, the lender would have no further recourse without a personal guarantee. The guarantee provides the lender with a secondary source of repayment from the personal assets of the developer or the directors and shareholders of the borrowing company.",
          "From the lender's perspective, a personal guarantee serves two purposes. First, it provides genuine financial recourse — if the development is sold at a loss, the lender can pursue the guarantor personally for the shortfall. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it aligns the developer's personal interests with the project's success. A developer who has guaranteed a £3,000,000 facility with their personal assets has a powerful incentive to manage the project diligently, control costs, and maximise the exit value. Lenders view this alignment of interests as an important risk mitigant.",
          "In our experience arranging hundreds of development finance facilities, only a small minority of lenders offer genuinely non-recourse development finance — and those that do typically require lower LTV ratios (fifty to fifty-five percent of GDV compared to sixty-five to seventy percent with a guarantee), higher interest rates, and more experienced developer track records. For most developers, particularly those with fewer than ten completed projects, a personal guarantee is a non-negotiable requirement of securing development finance at competitive terms.",

        heading: "Types of personal guarantee",
        content: [
          "Not all personal guarantees are the same, and understanding the differences is critical before signing. The broadest form is an unlimited personal guarantee, which makes the guarantor liable for the entire outstanding debt plus all costs, fees, default interest, and enforcement expenses incurred by the lender. On a £4,000,000 facility that defaults and incurs £200,000 in enforcement costs, an unlimited guarantee exposes the guarantor to the full £4,200,000 shortfall after the sale of the development.",
          "A limited personal guarantee caps the guarantor's liability at a specified amount — typically expressed as a percentage of the facility. A guarantee limited to twenty-five percent of a £4,000,000 facility caps personal liability at £1,000,000, regardless of the actual shortfall. Limited guarantees are clearly preferable for borrowers, and in our experience, many lenders will accept a limited guarantee in the range of fifteen to thirty percent of the facility for experienced developers with strong track records.",
          "Some guarantees are limited in scope rather than amount. For example, a cost-overrun guarantee limits the guarantor's liability to costs incurred above the approved build budget — effectively guaranteeing that the guarantor will fund any budget overruns from personal resources. Similarly, an interest guarantee covers only the interest on the facility, not the principal. These targeted guarantees are sometimes available from lenders who are comfortable with the security value but want protection against specific risks.",
          "A further distinction is between joint and several guarantees and several-only guarantees. In a joint and several guarantee (which is the most common form), each guarantor is liable for the full guaranteed amount — meaning the lender can pursue any one guarantor for the entire liability, regardless of how many guarantors there are. In a several-only guarantee, each guarantor is liable only for their proportionate share. If you are entering a joint venture development, the distinction between joint and several versus several liability is critically important, and you should insist on clear apportionment of guarantee liability between the JV partners.

          "A personal guarantee creates a direct, personal obligation on the guarantor. If called upon, the lender can pursue any of the guarantor's personal assets to recover the guaranteed amount. This includes: cash savings and investments, other property owned by the guarantor (including their family home, subject to certain protections discussed below), shares in other companies, vehicles, and any other assets of value. The lender can also seek a court order to intercept income, including salary, dividends, and rental income from other properties.",
          "The family home deserves special attention. If the guarantor's home is held in joint names with a spouse or partner who is not a party to the guarantee, the lender cannot simply seize and sell the home. However, the lender can obtain a charging order over the guarantor's beneficial interest in the property, which effectively creates a charge that must be paid when the property is eventually sold. In extreme cases, the lender can apply for an order for sale, although courts are reluctant to grant such orders where it would render the guarantor's family homeless, particularly where there are children. This is a complex area of law, and guarantors should take independent legal advice before signing.",
          "If the guarantor cannot pay the guaranteed amount, the lender may petition for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy has severe consequences: the guarantor's assets are placed under the control of a trustee in bankruptcy, they may be prohibited from acting as a company director, and their credit rating will be destroyed for a minimum of six years. The threat of bankruptcy proceedings is a powerful tool that lenders use to compel payment, even where the guarantor claims to have insufficient assets to satisfy the guarantee. In our experience, bankruptcy petitions are relatively rare in development finance — most lenders prefer to negotiate a settlement — but the possibility should not be discounted.",
          "One area that catches many developers by surprise is the interaction between personal guarantees and other business interests. If you have guaranteed a development loan and that loan defaults, the stress on your personal finances can affect your ability to service other borrowings, maintain deposits on other development sites, and satisfy the credit requirements of other lenders. A personal guarantee default can therefore have a cascading effect across your entire property portfolio. This is why we always advise developers to assess their total guarantee exposure across all facilities and ensure they have a clear picture of their worst-case personal liability.",

          "While personal guarantees are typically non-negotiable in principle, the terms of the guarantee are often negotiable in practice. The most important negotiation point is whether the guarantee is limited or unlimited. We always push for limited guarantees on behalf of our clients, and in many cases we have negotiated guarantee caps of fifteen to twenty-five percent of the facility amount. The key factors that support a lower guarantee cap are: a strong developer track record, conservative LTV (below sixty percent LTGDV), a well-located development with strong comparable evidence, and the availability of other security (such as a second charge over the developer's other assets).",
          "Another important negotiation point is the mechanism for release of the guarantee. Many guarantees provide that the guarantee is automatically released when the facility is repaid in full. However, some guarantees contain provisions that allow partial release as the facility balance reduces — for example, the guarantee reducing pro rata as units are sold and the loan balance decreases. We negotiate for partial release wherever possible, as it rewards the developer for achieving sales and reduces their exposure progressively throughout the sales period.",
          "The guarantee documentation should be reviewed carefully by the guarantor's own solicitor — not the lender's solicitor, who acts for the lender and cannot advise the guarantor. Key provisions to scrutinise include: the scope of the guarantee (does it cover principal only, or also interest, fees, and enforcement costs?), the circumstances in which the guarantee can be called (only after the security has been realised, or at any time following default?), any provisions requiring the guarantor to make payments on demand, and the governing law and jurisdiction for any disputes.",
          "In our experience, the most effective way to negotiate a favourable guarantee is to present the lender with a comprehensive picture of the developer's personal net worth and existing commitments. A developer with a personal net worth of £2,000,000 and no other guarantee exposures is a stronger guarantor than one with the same net worth but £1,500,000 of existing guarantee liabilities. Providing a detailed personal financial statement, including assets, liabilities, income, and commitments, demonstrates transparency and gives the lender confidence that the guarantee has substance. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Contact our deal room</a> for help structuring your guarantee position on a new or existing facility.",

          "A personal guarantee is typically called after the development has been sold (either by the developer or by a receiver) and the proceeds are insufficient to repay the lender in full. The lender will serve a formal demand on the guarantor for payment of the guaranteed amount (or the actual shortfall, if less than the guarantee cap). The demand will specify a payment deadline — typically fourteen to twenty-eight days — after which the lender will pursue enforcement action.",
          "Upon receiving a demand, the guarantor should immediately seek specialist legal advice. The solicitor will review the guarantee documentation, assess whether the demand is valid (checking that the lender has properly realised its security and that the amount demanded is correctly calculated), and advise on the guarantor's options. These options include: paying the demanded amount in full, negotiating a settlement for a reduced amount, offering a payment plan, or challenging the demand on legal grounds (for example, if the lender failed to act in good faith in realising the security).",
          "Settlement negotiations are common in personal guarantee disputes. Lenders know that pursuing a guarantor through the courts is time-consuming and expensive, and that the outcome is uncertain — particularly if the guarantor's assets are limited or difficult to realise. A lender may accept a settlement of fifty to seventy percent of the demanded amount if it can be paid quickly and without the cost and delay of litigation. We have seen settlements negotiated for as little as thirty percent of the original demand where the guarantor engaged early, provided full financial disclosure, and made a realistic offer.",
          "If the guarantor cannot pay and no settlement is reached, the lender will typically commence legal proceedings. The most common route is a claim in the High Court or County Court for the guaranteed amount, followed (if judgment is obtained) by enforcement of the judgment through charging orders over property, third-party debt orders to freeze bank accounts, and ultimately a bankruptcy petition if the debt remains unpaid. The litigation process can take twelve to eighteen months and costs both parties significant legal fees — which is why most personal guarantee disputes are resolved through negotiation rather than trial.",

          "The best time to protect yourself against personal guarantee liability is before you sign the guarantee — not after a default has occurred. The first step is to obtain independent legal advice from a solicitor who is not acting for the lender or the borrowing company. The solicitor should explain the terms of the guarantee in plain language, ensure you understand the extent of your potential liability, and advise on any amendments that could be negotiated to limit your exposure.",
          "Consider whether your personal financial structure can be arranged to minimise exposure. For example, some developers hold their family home in the sole name of their spouse or partner, reducing the assets available to a lender pursuing a guarantee. This must be done well in advance of signing the guarantee — transferring assets after signing (or in anticipation of a default) can be challenged as a transaction at an undervalue or a transaction defrauding creditors under the Insolvency Act 1986, with serious consequences including criminal liability.",
          "Insurance products that protect against personal guarantee liability do exist, although they are relatively niche and can be expensive. Personal guarantee insurance typically covers a specified percentage of the guarantee liability in the event of a default, with premiums of two to five percent of the insured amount per annum. The insurance does not prevent the guarantee from being called — it simply provides a source of funds to meet all or part of the demand. We can introduce developers to specialist insurance brokers who provide this product.",
          "Finally, build your development appraisal with personal guarantee risk in mind. Ensure the project has sufficient profit margin to absorb cost overruns and market softening without creating a shortfall. A project with twenty percent profit on GDV can absorb a ten to fifteen percent cost overrun or value decline before the sale proceeds fall below the facility balance. A project with twelve percent profit margin has almost no buffer. The higher the profit margin, the less likely it is that your personal guarantee will ever be called.

Where two or more parties are developing a project together through an SPV, the lender will typically require personal guarantees from all parties with a significant equity stake. The critical question is how the guarantee liability is apportioned between the JV partners — and the answer depends on whether the guarantee is joint and several or several only.",
          "In a joint and several guarantee, each guarantor is liable for the full guaranteed amount. This means that if one guarantor cannot pay, the lender can recover the entire amount from the other guarantor(s). In a 50/50 JV where both partners give a joint and several guarantee for £500,000, each partner is potentially liable for the full £500,000, not just their fifty percent share of £250,000. This is a significant risk that many JV partners fail to appreciate until a default occurs.",
          "We always advise JV partners to negotiate several-only guarantees where possible, so that each guarantor is liable only for their proportionate share of the guarantee. If the lender insists on joint and several liability, the JV partners should enter into a counter-indemnity agreement between themselves, under which each partner agrees to reimburse the other for any payment made under the guarantee in excess of their proportionate share. This does not eliminate the risk (because the counter-indemnity is only as good as the indemnifying party's ability to pay), but it provides a contractual framework for apportioning liability.",
          "The JV agreement should also address what happens if one partner wants to provide a larger or smaller guarantee than the other. In some cases, one partner may be willing to provide a larger guarantee in exchange for a larger share of the profits, or one partner may have limited personal assets and can only offer a smaller guarantee. These arrangements should be clearly documented in the JV agreement and reflected in the guarantee documentation.

        content: [
          "An intercreditor agreement (ICA) is a contract between two or more lenders that defines their respective rights, priorities, and obligations in relation to a shared borrower. In <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a>, the most common intercreditor arrangement is between a senior lender (who provides the primary development facility) and a <a href=\"/services#mezzanine-finance\">mezzanine lender</a> (who provides additional debt to bridge the gap between the senior facility and the developer's equity). The intercreditor agreement governs what happens when things go right — how repayments are distributed — and, critically, what happens when things go wrong — who has priority, who controls enforcement, and who bears losses.",
          "The need for an intercreditor agreement arises because both lenders have security over the same development, but their interests are not perfectly aligned. The senior lender, whose facility ranks ahead of the mezzanine debt, wants to protect its priority position and ensure that the mezzanine lender's actions do not prejudice its security. The mezzanine lender, whose facility ranks behind the senior debt and therefore carries higher risk, wants to ensure it has sufficient information, influence, and rights to protect its investment. The intercreditor agreement balances these competing interests through a set of detailed provisions.",
          "For developers, understanding the intercreditor agreement is essential because it directly affects your ability to manage the project, make decisions, and respond to problems. The intercreditor agreement may restrict your ability to draw mezzanine funds, require you to obtain consent from both lenders for certain actions, and determine the sequence of enforcement if the project defaults. In our experience, developers who understand their intercreditor agreement are better equipped to navigate the complexities of a dual-lender capital structure.",

        heading: "Key provisions of a typical intercreditor agreement",
        content: [
          "The most important provision in any intercreditor agreement is the payment waterfall — the agreed order in which proceeds from the development are distributed. In a typical development finance ICA, the waterfall provides that all proceeds from unit sales or refinancing are applied first to repay the senior lender's facility in full (including interest, fees, and costs), then to repay the mezzanine lender's facility, and finally to return any surplus to the borrower. This means the mezzanine lender receives nothing until the senior lender is repaid in full, which is why mezzanine finance carries higher interest rates (typically twelve to twenty percent per annum) than senior debt.",
          "The second key provision is the standstill or non-action clause, which restricts the mezzanine lender's ability to take enforcement action. A typical standstill clause provides that the mezzanine lender cannot enforce its security, demand repayment, or appoint a receiver for a specified period (usually ninety to one hundred and eighty days) following a default, during which time the senior lender has exclusive control of the enforcement process. This prevents the mezzanine lender from taking actions that could disrupt the senior lender's recovery strategy.",
          "The third key provision is the cure right, which gives the mezzanine lender the option to remedy a senior default by paying the overdue amounts to the senior lender. This right is important for mezzanine lenders because it allows them to prevent a senior enforcement that might result in a fire sale of the development at a price that recovers the senior debt but leaves nothing for the mezzanine lender. By curing the senior default and keeping the project alive, the mezzanine lender protects its position — although it is effectively injecting additional capital at risk.",
          "Other important provisions include: information rights (the mezzanine lender's right to receive copies of monitoring surveyor reports, financial covenants tests, and default notices), consent rights (matters on which both lenders must agree, such as changes to the build programme or budget exceeding a specified threshold), and release provisions (the conditions under which individual units can be released from the lenders' security to enable sales). Each of these provisions can have a significant impact on the developer's ability to manage the project, and they should be understood before the capital structure is finalised.",

        heading: "How intercreditor agreements affect developers",
        content: [
          "From a developer's perspective, the intercreditor agreement creates an additional layer of complexity in managing the project. Decisions that would require consent from one lender in a single-lender structure may require consent from both lenders in a dual-lender structure. For example, if you need to change your main contractor, vary the build programme, or adjust the specification, you may need approval from both the senior and mezzanine lender. This can slow down decision-making and create frustration, particularly when the two lenders have different views on the appropriate course of action.",
          "The drawdown mechanics for mezzanine finance are also governed by the intercreditor agreement. Typically, the senior facility is drawn first (on a day-one land advance and then staged construction drawdowns), with the mezzanine facility drawn either on day one (to supplement the developer's equity for the land purchase) or later in the build programme when the senior facility is fully drawn and additional funds are needed. The sequencing of drawdowns affects the developer's cash flow and the total cost of finance, because interest accrues from the date of drawdown.",
          "Perhaps most significantly, the intercreditor agreement determines what happens to the developer's position if the project defaults. If the senior lender enforces and appoints a receiver, the mezzanine lender is typically subject to a standstill and cannot take any action to protect its position (other than exercising its cure right, if it has the resources to do so). The developer is caught between two lenders with potentially conflicting interests — the senior lender wanting a quick sale to recover its debt, and the mezzanine lender wanting to maximise the sale price to preserve some recovery for itself. The developer's equity is at the bottom of the waterfall and is the most vulnerable in a default scenario.",
          "We always advise developers to be actively involved in the negotiation of the intercreditor agreement, even though it is primarily a contract between the two lenders. Your solicitor should review the ICA and ensure that the developer's interests are protected — for example, that the developer has the right to receive copies of all notices exchanged between the lenders, that the developer's consent is required for certain actions by the receiver, and that the developer has the opportunity to propose an alternative resolution before enforcement proceeds. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Contact our deal room</a> if you need help structuring a capital stack that includes both senior and mezzanine debt.",

          "Disagreements between senior and mezzanine lenders are most common in default scenarios, where the two lenders may have fundamentally different views on the best course of action. The senior lender, whose debt ranks first and whose recovery is more likely to be achieved in full, may favour a quick sale of the development — even at a discount to market value — to crystallise its recovery and deploy its capital elsewhere. The mezzanine lender, whose recovery depends on achieving a higher sale price, may prefer to hold the development, complete any outstanding works, and market it more aggressively to achieve a premium price.",
          "The intercreditor agreement resolves this tension through the priority and control provisions. In most ICAs, the senior lender has the right to control enforcement and make decisions about the disposal of the property during the enforcement process. The mezzanine lender's remedies are limited to its cure right (paying off the senior default), its right to purchase the senior debt (effectively stepping into the senior lender's shoes), and its right to receive the surplus proceeds after the senior debt is repaid.",
          "In practice, we have seen situations where the tension between lenders creates opportunities for developers. If the senior lender and mezzanine lender are in disagreement, the developer may be able to propose a solution that satisfies both — for example, <a href=\"/guides/refinancing-distressed-development\">refinancing the entire capital structure</a> with a single new lender, or injecting additional equity to cure the senior default and restructure the mezzanine facility. Developers who are proactive and creative in default situations can sometimes navigate a path through the intercreditor dynamics that preserves their equity position.",
          "It is worth noting that some intercreditor agreements contain dispute resolution mechanisms, such as a requirement to refer disagreements to an independent expert or a mediation process. These mechanisms can be valuable in avoiding the deadlock that sometimes occurs when two lenders with conflicting interests are unable to agree on a course of action. If your capital structure includes both senior and mezzanine debt, ensure the intercreditor agreement contains a workable dispute resolution mechanism.",

It allows the mezzanine lender to remedy a default under the senior facility by paying the overdue amounts directly to the senior lender. This prevents the senior lender from enforcing its security and allows the development to continue, preserving the mezzanine lender's prospect of recovery.",
          "In practice, exercising the cure right is a significant decision for the mezzanine lender. Curing a senior default means injecting additional capital into a project that is already in difficulty. If the underlying problems (cost overruns, programme delays, or market softening) are not addressed, the mezzanine lender may find itself curing repeated defaults and escalating its exposure without improving its recovery prospects. A prudent mezzanine lender will only exercise its cure right if it believes the development can still be completed and sold at a price that recovers both the senior debt and a meaningful portion of the mezzanine debt.",
          "The intercreditor agreement typically specifies the procedure for exercising the cure right: the mezzanine lender must notify the senior lender within a specified period (usually five to ten business days) of receiving the default notice, and must pay the curing amounts within a further specified period (usually ten to fifteen business days). If the mezzanine lender fails to cure within these timeframes, the senior lender is free to proceed with enforcement. The amounts paid by the mezzanine lender to cure the senior default are typically added to the mezzanine facility balance and rank behind the senior debt in the payment waterfall.",
          "For developers, the mezzanine lender's cure right can be a lifeline in a default situation. If your mezzanine lender is willing and able to cure the senior default, it buys time to address the underlying issues and avoid enforcement. However, developers should be aware that mezzanine lenders who exercise their cure right will typically demand additional protections in return — such as a higher interest rate, additional security, or greater control over the project. The relationship between the developer and the mezzanine lender becomes even more important when the mezzanine lender is effectively propping up the capital structure.

          "Key provisions to negotiate include: the threshold for decisions that require dual-lender consent (ideally, this should be set at a level that allows the developer to manage day-to-day operations without constantly seeking approval from both lenders — a threshold of ten to fifteen percent of the build budget for variations is common), the notice provisions (ensuring the developer receives copies of all notices exchanged between the lenders), the release price mechanism for individual unit sales (ensuring the release prices are set at a level that allows competitive pricing in the market), and the developer's rights in an enforcement scenario.",
          "The timing of when the mezzanine facility is drawn relative to the senior facility should also be addressed in the intercreditor agreement. If the mezzanine is drawn on day one, the total interest cost is higher but the developer has immediate access to the full capital structure. If the mezzanine is drawn later in the build, interest savings are achieved but the developer must manage cash flow carefully to ensure funds are available when needed. We model both scenarios for our clients and advise on the optimal drawdown strategy based on the specific project economics.",

          "Common restructuring scenarios include: extending the term of both facilities, increasing the senior facility to fund cost overruns (which may require the mezzanine lender to subordinate to a larger senior debt), converting mezzanine debt to equity (which changes the mezzanine lender's position from creditor to co-owner), and refinancing the entire capital structure with a single replacement lender. Each scenario has implications under the intercreditor agreement, and the consent of both lenders is typically required.",

They serve as early warning mechanisms for the lender, designed to identify problems before they become critical. While the loan itself may not be in arrears, a breach of covenant constitutes a default event under the facility agreement and gives the lender the right to take remedial action — including, ultimately, enforcement of its security.",
          "Development finance facilities typically contain two categories of covenants: financial covenants and non-financial (or operational) covenants. Financial covenants set quantitative thresholds that the borrower must maintain — for example, the loan-to-value ratio must not exceed seventy percent, or the projected profit margin must not fall below fifteen percent of GDV. Non-financial covenants impose behavioural requirements — for example, the borrower must maintain insurance, comply with planning permissions, provide regular progress reports, and not change the scope of works without lender consent.",

Some breaches are technical and easily remedied — for example, a late progress report can usually be resolved by submitting the report promptly.

An LTV covenant requires the outstanding loan balance not to exceed a specified percentage of the current value of the development. An LTC covenant limits the loan as a proportion of total project costs. An LTGDV covenant caps the loan relative to the projected value of the completed development. A typical facility might contain all three covenants, each set at different thresholds.",
          "LTV covenant breaches are most commonly triggered by falls in property values. If the market softens or the monitoring surveyor revalues the development at a lower figure than originally assumed, the LTV ratio increases even though the loan balance has not changed. For example, a £2,000,000 loan against a property valued at £3,000,000 represents sixty-seven percent LTV. If the property value drops to £2,700,000, the LTV increases to seventy-four percent — which may breach a seventy percent LTV covenant. We cover this topic in detail in our guide on <a href=\"/guides/loan-to-value-covenant-breaches\">LTV covenant breaches</a>.",

If the total project cost increases because of construction cost escalation, the LTC ratio changes even if the loan amount is unchanged. A £3,000,000 loan on a project with total costs of £4,500,000 represents sixty-seven percent LTC. If costs increase to £4,800,000 due to overruns, the LTC drops to sixty-three percent — which seems favourable but actually reflects the developer having to inject more equity, which may not be available. Conversely, if the lender has advanced additional funds, the ratio will worsen.",
          "LTGDV covenant breaches can occur from either direction — an increase in the loan balance (due to additional drawdowns or capitalised interest) or a decrease in the projected GDV (due to market softening or a revised appraisal). The monitoring surveyor's regular assessments of GDV are the primary mechanism through which LTGDV covenants are tested, and a downward revision to GDV can trigger a breach even if the development is progressing well on site. Developers should monitor comparable sales evidence throughout the build programme and challenge any GDV assessment that they believe is unduly conservative.",

          "Non-financial covenants cover a wide range of operational requirements, and breaches are surprisingly common. The most frequently breached non-financial covenants in our experience are: failure to provide information within the required timeframe (monitoring surveyor reports, financial accounts, insurance certificates), failure to comply with the approved build programme or specification without lender consent, changes to the corporate structure of the borrower (such as a change of directors or shareholders) without notification, and breach of planning conditions or building regulations.",
          "Insurance covenants deserve particular attention. Development finance facilities invariably require the borrower to maintain comprehensive insurance covering the development works, public liability, and employer's liability, with the lender noted as an interested party on the policy. A lapse in insurance coverage — even for a single day — constitutes a covenant breach and can trigger a default event. We have seen developers lose insurance coverage because of a missed premium payment or an administrative error, resulting in a breach notice from the lender. Ensure your insurance is set to auto-renew and that premium payment dates are diarised well in advance.",
          "Information covenants require the borrower to provide regular updates on the project's progress, finances, and any material events. The frequency and scope of reporting varies between lenders, but typically includes monthly or quarterly management accounts, copies of monitoring surveyor reports, notification of any planning or building control issues, and notification of any material contracts entered into or terminated. Failing to provide this information is a covenant breach and, importantly, can erode the lender's trust even if the project is otherwise progressing well.",
          "Construction programme covenants are common in development finance and require the borrower to complete specified milestones within agreed timeframes. For example, the covenant might require the superstructure to be complete within nine months of the first drawdown, or practical completion to be achieved within eighteen months. If the programme slips beyond these milestones, the covenant is breached. This is why realistic programming at the outset is so important — see our guide on <a href=\"/guides/programme-delays-development-loans\">programme delays and development loans</a> for detailed guidance.",

          "Many development finance facility agreements include cure periods for certain covenant breaches, during which the borrower can remedy the breach without the lender taking further action. A typical cure period is fifteen to thirty business days for financial covenant breaches and five to ten business days for information covenant breaches. The cure period begins when the borrower receives notice of the breach (or, in some agreements, when the breach occurs, regardless of notice).",
          "Remedying a financial covenant breach within the cure period typically requires the borrower to take action that restores the covenant ratio to the required level. For an LTV breach, this might mean injecting additional equity to reduce the loan balance — for example, if the LTV has breached at seventy-three percent against a seventy percent covenant, the borrower might need to make a partial repayment of approximately £90,000 on a £3,000,000 facility to bring the ratio back within the covenant. For an LTGDV breach, the borrower might need to provide evidence of pre-sales or revised comparable evidence that supports a higher GDV.",
          "For non-financial covenant breaches, remediation is usually more straightforward but must be completed promptly. A lapsed insurance policy should be renewed immediately and confirmation provided to the lender. A late progress report should be submitted as soon as possible. A change in the borrower's corporate structure should be notified and consent sought retrospectively (although some lenders may treat an unauthorised change as a non-curable breach). The key principle is that the borrower should demonstrate good faith by taking immediate and effective remedial action.",
          "If the breach cannot be remedied within the cure period, the borrower should communicate with the lender (or through their broker) to explain the circumstances and propose a realistic timeline for remediation. In our experience, lenders will often agree to an informal extension of the cure period if the borrower is engaging constructively and the breach is not causing material harm to the lender's security. A borrower who ignores a breach notice or fails to communicate with the lender during the cure period will almost always face an escalation to formal enforcement. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Contact our deal room</a> if you are facing a covenant breach and need assistance engaging with your lender.",

        content: [
          "If a covenant breach cannot be remedied (for example, because the property value has genuinely declined and no additional equity is available), the borrower can request a covenant waiver or amendment from the lender. A waiver is a one-off agreement by the lender to overlook a specific breach, while an amendment is a permanent change to the covenant threshold. Both require the lender's agreement and typically involve a fee — usually £2,500 to £10,000 depending on the lender and the complexity of the waiver.",
          "To support a waiver or amendment request, the borrower should provide evidence that the underlying project remains viable despite the covenant breach. For example, if an LTV breach has been triggered by a property revaluation but the development is on programme and pre-sales evidence supports the original GDV assumption, this demonstrates that the breach is a function of conservative valuation methodology rather than a genuine deterioration in the project's prospects. Similarly, if an LTC breach has been caused by cost overruns that the borrower has funded from additional equity, the lender's exposure has not increased and a waiver may be readily granted.",
          "Lenders consider several factors when assessing a waiver request: the severity of the breach (a marginal breach is easier to waive than a significant one), the cause of the breach (a market-driven breach may be treated more sympathetically than one caused by the borrower's management failures), the borrower's track record of covenant compliance (a first breach is treated differently from a repeated pattern), and the overall viability of the project. A well-prepared waiver request, presented by an experienced broker, has a high probability of success in most cases.",
          "It is worth noting that some facility agreements contain provisions that automatically waive minor covenant breaches — for example, a provision that an LTV breach of less than two percentage points is disregarded for the purposes of default. These materiality thresholds provide a useful buffer and should be negotiated at the outset of the facility. We always seek to include materiality thresholds in the facilities we arrange, as they provide an important protection against technical breaches that do not represent a genuine threat to the lender's security.",

        heading: "Cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses",

          "One of the most dangerous covenant provisions in development finance is the cross-default clause. A cross-default clause provides that a default under any other facility agreement to which the borrower (or a related entity) is a party constitutes a default under the current facility. This means that a covenant breach on one development can trigger a default on all of the developer's other financed projects, even if those projects are performing perfectly.",
          "The scope of cross-default clauses varies between lenders. Some are limited to defaults by the same borrower entity, while others extend to defaults by any entity in the borrower's corporate group, or even defaults by the guarantor personally. A developer with three projects financed by three different lenders, each with cross-default provisions referencing the other facilities, faces a potential domino effect where a single default triggers cascading defaults across the entire portfolio.",
          "Cross-acceleration clauses are similar but more aggressive. Where a cross-default clause simply creates a default event under the current facility (which may be curable), a cross-acceleration clause provides that if the debt under another facility is accelerated (demanded for immediate repayment), the current facility is also automatically accelerated. This can create a situation where the developer faces simultaneous demands for repayment across multiple facilities, which is almost certainly unmanageable.",
          "We always advise developers to negotiate the scope of cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions carefully. Ideally, cross-default clauses should be limited to defaults by the same borrower entity (not the wider corporate group) and should exclude technical defaults that do not result in enforcement action. Cross-acceleration clauses should be resisted entirely where possible. If cross-default provisions cannot be avoided, developers should consider structuring each development through a separate SPV with no cross-guarantees or cross-collateralisation, to contain the impact of a default on one project from spreading to others.",

          "Maintaining covenant compliance requires proactive monitoring and management throughout the facility term. The first step is to create a covenant compliance schedule that lists every covenant in your facility agreement, the threshold or requirement, the testing frequency, and the current status. This schedule should be reviewed monthly and updated with current data from the project accounts, monitoring surveyor reports, and market evidence.",
          "Second, build in early warning thresholds that alert you before a breach occurs. For example, if your LTV covenant is set at seventy percent, set an internal alert at sixty-five percent — giving you time to assess the situation and take preventive action before the covenant is actually breached. This might involve accelerating sales, obtaining a fresh valuation to challenge a conservative assessment, or arranging additional equity from reserve funds.",
          "Third, maintain a positive and transparent relationship with your monitoring surveyor. The monitoring surveyor is the lender's eyes and ears on the project, and their reports are the primary mechanism through which covenant compliance is assessed. If the monitoring surveyor is raising concerns about cost overruns, programme delays, or build quality, address these concerns promptly and thoroughly. A monitoring surveyor who has confidence in the developer's management of the project will produce reports that support covenant compliance, while one who is concerned about the project's direction will highlight risks that may trigger a lender review.",
          "Finally, ensure your professional team is aligned with the covenant compliance objective. Your quantity surveyor should be tracking costs against the approved budget and flagging variances early. Your project manager should be monitoring the programme against covenant milestones. Your solicitor should have provided you with a plain-language summary of all covenants and their implications at the time of drawdown. If any member of your professional team is not actively supporting covenant compliance, address this immediately — the cost of professional advice is minimal compared to the cost of a covenant breach.

The distress may be financial (cost overruns have exhausted the budget and contingency), operational (the contractor has become insolvent or the programme has fallen significantly behind schedule), market-related (sales values have dropped below the levels needed to repay the loan), or a combination of all three. The common thread is that the existing lender has lost confidence in the borrower's ability to repay the facility within the agreed terms.",
          "In the UK development finance market, distressed developments are more common than many developers realise. Our panel of specialist lenders estimates that ten to fifteen percent of all development finance facilities experience some form of distress during their term. The majority are resolved through negotiation, term extensions, or additional equity injection. However, a significant minority require refinancing with a new lender — either because the existing lender is unwilling to extend or amend the facility, or because the relationship between borrower and lender has broken down irretrievably.",

These lenders understand that distressed developments often have significant underlying value — the site, the partially completed building, and the planning permission all represent tangible assets — and that the distress is frequently caused by manageable problems rather than fundamental flaws in the project. Rescue finance is structured to address the specific circumstances of the distressed project and provide a platform for the developer to complete and exit the scheme.",
          "The most common form of rescue finance is a replacement development facility — a new <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> facility that repays the existing lender in full and provides additional funds to complete the construction. This type of facility is typically provided at a higher cost than mainstream development finance (interest rates of twelve to eighteen percent per annum and arrangement fees of two to three percent are typical), reflecting the higher risk and the specialist nature of the lending. However, the total cost of rescue finance is almost always less than the cost of receivership and enforcement.",
          "For developments that are complete or substantially complete but struggling with the exit, <a href=\"/services#development-exit-finance\">development exit finance</a> provides an alternative. This repays the development facility and gives the developer a structured period to sell or let the completed units at a pace that maximises value. Development exit facilities for distressed completions are available at rates from 0.75% to 1.25% per month, with terms of six to twenty-four months.",
          "In some cases, <a href=\"/services#mezzanine-finance\">mezzanine finance</a> can be arranged to sit behind the existing senior facility, providing additional funds to complete the build without requiring the senior lender to increase its exposure. This approach works where the senior lender is willing to permit additional subordinated debt and where the development has sufficient projected value to support the additional leverage. Mezzanine rescue finance is typically provided at fifteen to twenty percent per annum, reflecting the subordinated risk position.",

          "Specialist rescue lenders approach distressed developments differently from mainstream development finance lenders. The primary focus is on the residual value proposition: what is the development worth today (in its current state), what will it be worth when completed, and what will it cost to get from here to completion? If the numbers work — meaning the completed value significantly exceeds the total of the existing debt, the rescue finance, and the cost to complete — the lender will consider the proposition.",
          "The assessment typically begins with an independent valuation of the development in its current state. This is not the same as the original development appraisal — it is a realistic assessment of what the site and partially completed building would sell for today in an arm's-length transaction. For a development that is fifty percent complete, this figure is often significantly less than the amount already spent, because a partially completed building has limited utility and appeals only to a narrow market of developers willing to take on someone else's project. A typical rule of thumb is that a half-built development is worth forty to sixty percent of the completed GDV, minus the cost to complete.",
          "The rescue lender will also commission a detailed assessment of the cost to complete the development, usually from an independent quantity surveyor who is not connected with the original project team. This provides a fresh and objective view of the remaining budget, which is essential for underwriting the rescue facility. If the original QS reports are available, these will be reviewed but not relied upon — the rescue lender needs to form its own view of the remaining costs.",
          "The developer's track record and personal financial position are assessed, but with a more nuanced perspective than mainstream lenders apply. A developer whose project is distressed due to contractor insolvency or market conditions beyond their control will be viewed more favourably than one whose project has failed due to poor management decisions. Similarly, a developer who has engaged proactively with the problem and has a credible plan for completion will be assessed more positively than one who has buried their head in the sand. The developer's willingness to inject additional equity is also a key factor — rescue lenders want to see that the developer has meaningful financial commitment to the project's completion.",

          "Refinancing a distressed development is more complex and time-sensitive than a standard development finance application. The process typically unfolds over three to six weeks, although urgent cases can be completed in ten to fifteen working days. Speed is important because the existing lender may be on the verge of enforcement, and every day of delay increases the default interest accruing on the existing facility.",
          "The first step is a comprehensive assessment of the current position. This involves reviewing the existing facility documentation (to understand the debt quantum, the security structure, and any impediments to refinancing), obtaining a current valuation, commissioning a cost-to-complete assessment, and preparing a revised development appraisal that demonstrates the project's viability post-refinancing. We prepare this package on behalf of our clients and present it to the most appropriate lenders on our panel.",
          "The second step is engaging with the existing lender to agree the terms of the exit. The existing lender must consent to the redemption of the facility and the release of its security, and it must confirm the exact amount required to redeem the facility in full (including any accrued interest, default interest, and enforcement costs). This is known as a redemption statement, and obtaining it can sometimes be complicated by disputes about the amounts owed or the validity of default interest charges. Your solicitor should review the redemption statement carefully before it is accepted.",
          "The third step is completing the rescue facility with the new lender. This involves the standard loan completion process — execution of facility documentation, satisfaction of conditions precedent, and drawdown of funds — but compressed into a much shorter timeframe than normal. The new lender's solicitors and the borrower's solicitors must work in parallel to meet the deadline, which is usually dictated by the existing lender's enforcement timeline. We coordinate this process closely and have a network of solicitors experienced in urgent development finance completions who can meet tight deadlines. The typical total cost of refinancing a distressed development (including new lender arrangement fees, legal fees, and valuation) ranges from £30,000 to £100,000, depending on the facility size and complexity.",

Interest rates typically range from twelve to eighteen percent per annum, compared to seven to ten percent for standard development finance. Arrangement fees are two to three percent, compared to one to two percent for mainstream facilities. Some rescue lenders also charge a drawdown fee for each tranche of construction funding released, and an exit fee of one to two percent of the loan amount on redemption.",
          "On a £2,500,000 rescue facility over twelve months, the total cost of finance might be: interest of £300,000 to £450,000 (at twelve to eighteen percent per annum, rolled up), arrangement fee of £50,000 to £75,000, and legal and valuation costs of approximately £20,000 — a total of £370,000 to £545,000. This is a significant cost, but it must be compared with the alternative. A receivership on the same facility would typically cost £100,000 to £300,000 in receiver's fees alone, plus additional construction costs of fifteen to twenty-five percent above the developer's budget, plus the loss of any remaining equity in the project.",
          "In most cases, rescue finance is significantly cheaper than enforcement for all parties — the developer retains control and equity, the existing lender is repaid in full without the cost and delay of receivership, and the rescue lender earns a premium return on a facility secured against a tangible asset with a clear completion and exit path. This is why rescue finance exists as a viable market segment — it creates value for all parties when the alternative is destruction of value through enforcement.",
          "We always model the full cost of rescue finance against the alternative scenarios before recommending this route to our clients. In some cases, negotiating a term extension with the existing lender is more cost-effective than refinancing.

If the current value of the development (in its current state) does not provide adequate security for the rescue facility, no lender will advance the funds. This situation arises most commonly where the existing debt is high relative to the value of the partially completed development, or where the cost to complete has escalated to the point where the total investment exceeds the projected GDV. In these cases, the developer may need to inject significant additional equity, find a JV partner to contribute capital, or accept that the project cannot be refinanced and must be restructured or disposed of.",
          "Another common obstacle is the existing lender's refusal to cooperate. While most lenders prefer to be repaid through refinancing rather than enforcement, some lenders (particularly those in formal workout or special situations management) may impose unreasonable conditions on the redemption — for example, demanding default interest that the borrower disputes, or refusing to provide a redemption statement in a timely manner. In these situations, legal intervention may be necessary, and the rescue timeline may be extended.",
          "Title and planning issues can also obstruct refinancing. If the development has been partially completed in a way that does not comply with the planning permission or building regulations, the rescue lender will require these issues to be resolved before completion. Similarly, if there are unresolved boundary disputes, restrictive covenants, or access rights that were not identified in the original due diligence, these must be addressed. The rescue lender's solicitors will conduct full title diligence, and any issues discovered will need to be resolved before the facility can complete.",
          "Finally, the developer's personal financial position may be an obstacle. If the developer's personal guarantee on the existing facility has been called or is threatened, the developer's creditworthiness is impaired, which affects their ability to provide a personal guarantee to the rescue lender. In these situations, we explore options such as bringing in a co-guarantor, providing additional property security in lieu of a personal guarantee, or structuring the rescue facility on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis. Every distressed situation is different, and creative structuring is often required to overcome the specific obstacles presented by each case.",

Having this information ready will accelerate the advisory and refinancing process significantly.",

Construction stops, the site must be secured, and the developer must find a replacement contractor willing to take on a partially completed project — all while the facility clock continues to tick and interest accrues on the drawn balance. In our experience, contractor insolvency typically adds three to nine months to the build programme and increases the remaining build cost by fifteen to thirty percent.",

If the contractor's employees have left site, you may need to engage a security company to protect the works and materials.

Cooperate fully with this visit and ensure the QS assessment is available for the monitoring surveyor to review. The monitoring surveyor's report will be the key document in the lender's credit decision, and a report that confirms the developer's assessment builds confidence, while a report that identifies additional concerns will make the situation more difficult.",

In our experience, lenders will usually agree to increase the facility if the revised development appraisal demonstrates adequate profitability and the developer is injecting additional equity to share the burden. We have negotiated facility increases of £100,000 to £500,000 in contractor insolvency situations, typically with a modest increase in the interest rate and arrangement fee to reflect the additional risk.",

The replacement contractor is taking on another firm's work — with all the attendant risks of unknown quality, incomplete documentation, and potential latent defects. This risk premium means that the replacement contractor's price will almost always be higher than the original contractor would have charged for the same remaining works, typically by fifteen to thirty percent.",
          "The appointment process should be managed by the developer's project manager or QS, with the following steps. First, conduct a thorough audit of the works completed to date — including a defects survey, a review of compliance with the building contract specification, and a check that all works comply with building regulations. This information will be provided to prospective replacement contractors so they can price accurately and identify any remedial works required.",

The tender documents should include: the original building contract specification, the QS assessment of works completed and remaining, the results of the defects survey, the revised programme, and the terms upon which the replacement contractor will be engaged. Allow a minimum of two weeks for tender return — rushing this process risks receiving inaccurate or inflated tenders that could cause further problems later.",
          "Third, evaluate the tenders on the basis of price, programme, and the contractor's track record. The cheapest tender is not necessarily the best — a contractor who has experience of taking over partially completed developments and can demonstrate a realistic programme is more valuable than one who offers the lowest price but has no relevant experience. Check references, verify insurance, and ensure the contractor has adequate financial standing to complete the works. Your lender will also want to review the replacement contractor's credentials before approving the appointment, so factor this into the timeline.",

The most common is a performance bond, which is a guarantee from an insurance company or bank that the contractor will perform its obligations under the building contract. If the contractor fails to perform (including due to insolvency), the bond pays out to the employer, typically up to ten percent of the contract value. On a £1,500,000 building contract, a ten percent performance bond provides £150,000 of protection at a cost of approximately £4,500 to £7,500.",
          "A parent company guarantee (PCG) provides similar protection but from the contractor's parent company rather than a third-party insurer. If the contracting entity becomes insolvent, the parent company is liable to complete the works or fund the additional costs of completion. PCGs are only available where the contractor is part of a larger group, and they are only as valuable as the parent company's financial standing. A PCG from a financially strong parent company is an excellent protection; a PCG from a parent company that is itself in financial difficulty provides little comfort.",
          "Retention provisions in the building contract also provide a degree of protection. Under standard JCT contracts, the employer retains a percentage of each interim payment (typically three to five percent) as security against defects. If the contractor becomes insolvent, the retained funds are available to the employer to fund the cost of completing outstanding and remedial works. On a £1,800,000 contract with five percent retention, this provides £90,000 of protection.",
          "Collateral warranties from key subcontractors provide an additional layer of protection. If the main contractor becomes insolvent, collateral warranties allow the employer to engage key subcontractors directly to continue their works without interruption. This can significantly reduce the disruption caused by contractor insolvency, as the employer can maintain continuity of specialist works (mechanical and electrical, for example) while appointing a new main contractor to manage the general works. We always recommend that developers obtain collateral warranties from key subcontractors at the start of the project — the cost is minimal (typically £500 to £1,000 per warranty) and the protection is significant.

Check your building contract to determine who is responsible for maintaining insurance — under JCT Design and Build contracts, the responsibility depends on which insurance option was selected at the outset.",
          "If the contractor was responsible for maintaining insurance, the developer must arrange replacement cover immediately. This should include: contract works all-risks insurance (covering the partially completed building and materials on site against damage from fire, storm, flood, and other perils), public liability insurance (covering claims from third parties injured on or near the site), and employer's liability insurance (which will be required once a replacement contractor is appointed). The cost of arranging replacement insurance typically ranges from £3,000 to £10,000 depending on the project size and the remaining term.",

The most important step is thorough due diligence on the contractor before appointment. Check the contractor's financial accounts (available from Companies House), assess their credit rating through a commercial credit agency (a report costs approximately £30 to £100), take references from recent clients, and verify their insurance and bonding capacity. A contractor who is thinly capitalised, has declining turnover, or shows increasing debt levels is at higher risk of insolvency.",
          "Structure the building contract to minimise your exposure. Use stage payments tied to verified milestones rather than monthly valuations, which reduces the risk of overpaying for incomplete work. Ensure retention provisions are included and enforced. Require performance bonds or parent company guarantees as a condition of the building contract. And include termination provisions that give you clear rights to terminate the contractor's employment and engage a replacement if the contractor enters insolvency proceedings.",
          "Monitor your contractor's financial health throughout the build programme, not just at the appointment stage. Signs of financial distress include: requests for advance payments or accelerated invoicing, a slowdown in the pace of works without clear explanation, subcontractors and suppliers contacting you directly about unpaid invoices, and a reduction in the number of operatives on site. If you observe any of these warning signs, investigate immediately and begin contingency planning for a potential contractor change.",

          "Most developers assume that once planning permission has been granted and their <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> facility has been drawn down, the planning risk has been eliminated. This is a dangerous assumption. Planning issues can arise after drawdown in several ways: a judicial review challenge to the planning permission, failure to discharge pre-commencement conditions before starting work (which renders the entire permission invalid), enforcement action by the local planning authority for breach of conditions during construction, or a successful challenge by a third party that results in the permission being quashed.",
          "The most common post-drawdown planning issue we encounter is failure to properly discharge pre-commencement conditions. Planning permissions routinely include conditions that must be formally discharged before any construction work begins — for example, approval of materials, archaeological investigations, contamination assessments, and construction management plans. If the developer starts work before these conditions are formally discharged (even if they have submitted the applications), the planning permission may be technically invalid. This creates a situation where the development has commenced, the finance has been drawn, but there is no valid planning permission in place.",
          "Judicial review challenges, while less common, can be devastating when they succeed. A judicial review must typically be brought within six weeks of the planning decision, but the proceedings can take six to twelve months to resolve. If the judicial review is successful and the planning permission is quashed, the developer is left with a partially completed building and no permission to complete it. The development may need to be redesigned, a new planning application submitted, and — in the worst case — the partially completed works may need to be demolished. The financial impact on the development finance facility can be catastrophic.",

          "Planning issues after drawdown have an immediate and direct impact on the development finance facility. Most facility agreements contain a condition requiring the borrower to maintain a valid and implementable planning permission throughout the term of the facility. Loss of planning permission — whether through revocation, quashing on judicial review, or invalidation due to breach of conditions — constitutes a breach of this condition and triggers a default event under the facility agreement.",
          "The lender's response to a planning default depends on the nature and severity of the issue. A minor condition breach that can be remedied (for example, a condition requiring approval of external materials that was overlooked but can be submitted retrospectively) will typically be treated as a curable default, with the lender granting a reasonable period for remediation. A fundamental planning failure — such as a judicial review quashing the permission entirely — is far more serious and may prompt the lender to accelerate the facility and commence enforcement proceedings.",
          "The impact on the development's value is also significant. A development with valid planning permission has a clear and quantifiable value based on the projected GDV. A development without planning permission — or with uncertain planning status — is worth significantly less, because any purchaser would need to factor in the cost, time, and risk of obtaining a new permission. In our experience, a development site without planning permission is typically worth thirty to fifty percent less than the same site with a valid, implementable permission. This reduction in value can push the facility into an LTV covenant breach, compounding the planning default with a financial covenant default.",
          "For developments that are partially completed when the planning issue arises, the situation is even more challenging. A partially completed building without planning permission is an asset that is difficult to value and even more difficult to sell. The building cannot be completed and occupied without planning permission, but demolishing it and starting again is expensive and wasteful. The lender's security is therefore significantly impaired, which increases the likelihood of enforcement action.",

For pre-commencement condition discharge failures, the most common remedy is to apply for a certificate of lawfulness (Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990) or to submit retrospective planning condition discharge applications. In many cases, the local planning authority will cooperate with retrospective discharge where the substance of the condition has been complied with, even if the formal approval was not obtained before works commenced. This process typically takes four to eight weeks and costs £2,000 to £5,000 in planning consultant fees plus the application fees.",
          "For more fundamental planning failures, such as a judicial review quashing the permission, the remediation is more complex. The developer will need to submit a new planning application, which may need to address the issues that led to the original permission being quashed. If the judicial review succeeded on procedural grounds (for example, inadequate consultation), the new application may be straightforward. If it succeeded on substantive grounds (for example, unacceptable impact on a conservation area), the scheme may need to be redesigned, which adds cost and delay. A new planning application for a residential development typically takes eight to thirteen weeks for determination, plus any additional time for pre-application discussions.",
          "In some cases, the planning issue may be resolvable through a Section 73 application (to vary or remove conditions) or a non-material amendment application (Section 96A). These routes are quicker and less expensive than a full planning application, but they are only available for relatively minor changes. Your planning consultant should advise on the most appropriate route based on the specific circumstances of the planning failure.",
          "Throughout the remediation process, keep your lender fully informed. Provide copies of all planning correspondence, consultant advice, and application submissions. Demonstrate that you have a credible plan for resolving the issue within a realistic timeframe, and quantify the cost impact on the project. In our experience, lenders will typically grant a standstill period while planning remediation is pursued, provided the borrower is engaging constructively and the remediation strategy is credible.

Enforcement action may be taken where the developer is building in material deviation from the approved plans, where conditions are being breached during construction (for example, working hours restrictions, construction traffic routes, or dust suppression measures), or where unauthorised development has taken place. The enforcement process begins with an enforcement notice, which specifies the breach and the steps required to remedy it, and gives the developer a compliance period (typically twenty-eight days to six months depending on the nature of the breach).",
          "The impact of enforcement action on the development finance facility depends on the severity of the breach and the requirements of the enforcement notice. A minor breach that can be remedied within the compliance period (for example, reducing site operating hours to comply with a condition) is unlikely to cause serious problems with the lender, provided the developer addresses the issue promptly. A major breach that requires demolition of unauthorised works or a significant design change will have a material impact on the project's cost, programme, and value.",
          "Developers should be aware that enforcement notices can be appealed to the Planning Inspectorate under Section 174 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. An appeal suspends the enforcement notice until it is determined, buying time for the developer. However, appeals take several months to resolve and involve significant costs (£5,000 to £20,000 in planning consultant and legal fees), and there is no guarantee of success. The decision to appeal should be made in consultation with a planning solicitor and a planning consultant who can assess the merits of the case.",
          "In our experience, the best strategy for managing enforcement risk is prevention. Ensure your site manager and contractor are fully aware of all planning conditions and restrictions. Display the planning conditions on site in a prominent location. Brief all subcontractors on working hours, delivery routes, and other operational conditions. And monitor compliance throughout the build. A proactive approach to planning compliance costs nothing and avoids the significant disruption and expense of enforcement action.

Premiums for planning indemnity insurance typically range from £500 to £5,000 depending on the risk covered and the sum insured, and the policies are available from specialist title insurance providers.",

This product is relatively niche but can be valuable for developments where a judicial review challenge is considered possible (for example, where there was significant local objection to the planning application). Premiums are typically three to five percent of the sum insured, and the policy can cover both the legal costs of defending the judicial review and the financial consequences if the challenge succeeds.",

Professional negligence claims are complex and expensive to pursue, but they can provide a route to recovery where significant losses have been incurred.",

The cost of these insurance products is a legitimate development cost that should be included in the project budget from the outset. On a typical residential development with a GDV of £3,000,000 to £5,000,000, the total cost of planning-related insurance might be £2,000 to £8,000 — a small price for the protection it provides.",

We engaged a specialist planning solicitor and planning consultant who reviewed the position and advised that the substance of the conditions had been complied with (the required surveys and assessments had been carried out) but the formal discharge applications had not been submitted. The strategy was to submit retrospective discharge applications for all three conditions and simultaneously apply for a certificate of lawfulness confirming that the development could lawfully continue.",

For developers managing financed projects, we recommend a pre-commencement condition audit by the planning consultant before any works begin on site.

Slower sales extend the exit timeline, threatening the facility's maturity date. Buyer hesitancy leads to price reductions, further eroding the profit margin that provides the buffer between the sale proceeds and the outstanding debt. And the general market uncertainty makes lenders more cautious, less willing to extend facilities or accommodate covenant breaches.",

Residential values in parts of Greater London fell by fifteen to twenty-five percent within twelve months, while some regional markets experienced declines of twenty to thirty percent. Developers who had borrowed at sixty-five to seventy percent LTGDV found themselves in negative equity on their facilities, with completed developments worth less than the outstanding debt.

These indicators typically appear three to six months before headline price indices register a decline, giving proactive developers a valuable head start.",
          "At a local level, monitor the performance of comparable developments. If similar schemes in your area are reducing prices, increasing incentives (such as contribution to stamp duty or fixtures and fittings packages), or reporting slower sales rates, these are direct indicators that your own scheme may face similar conditions. Attend local property shows and networking events, speak to estate agents who are active in your market area, and review the latest Land Registry transaction data to build a picture of current market conditions.",
          "Lender behaviour is another useful indicator. If development finance lenders are reducing their maximum LTV ratios, increasing their interest rates, or tightening their underwriting criteria (for example, requiring higher profit margins or more evidence of demand), this suggests that the lending community is becoming cautious about market conditions. Our panel of lenders provides us with regular market commentary, and we share relevant insights with our clients to help them make informed decisions about timing and structuring of new facilities.",

Every scheme is affected by the broader market, and it is far better to adjust your strategy pre-emptively than to wait until the impact is felt directly. Consider accelerating your build programme to reach practical completion before the market deteriorates further, launching the sales programme earlier, and reviewing your pricing strategy to ensure it is competitive in the current market.

A well-prepared waiver request submitted before the breach is far more likely to succeed than a reactive response after the lender has identified the breach through the monitoring surveyor's report.",
          "In some cases, the lender may require the borrower to reduce the facility balance to restore the covenant ratio. This is known as a cash cure or equity top-up. For example, if the LTGDV covenant requires the loan not to exceed sixty-five percent of GDV, and a revaluation has pushed the ratio to sixty-eight percent, the borrower may need to repay sufficient loan balance to bring the ratio back below sixty-five percent. On a £3,000,000 facility with a revised GDV of £4,400,000, the required repayment would be approximately £140,000. If the developer cannot fund this from available resources, alternative options include arranging a small <a href=\"/services#bridging-loans\">bridging loan</a> against other assets, bringing in a JV partner, or negotiating an amended covenant threshold with the lender.",

A more effective strategy is to price competitively from the outset — achieving five to seven percent less per unit but selling within three months is almost always more profitable than achieving full price but taking twelve months, once the additional interest costs (approximately £15,000 to £25,000 per month on a typical facility) and extension fees are factored in.",
          "Consider offering incentives that do not reduce the headline price. Stamp duty contributions, furniture packages, legal fee contributions, and deposit assistance schemes can make your development more attractive to buyers without triggering down-valuations by mortgage surveyors (who may use lower comparable evidence to value your units if the headline price is reduced). The cost of these incentives is typically two to five percent of the unit price — significant, but often less than the cost of prolonged marketing.",
          "Explore alternative sales channels. If individual unit sales are slow, consider whether the entire development (or a significant portion of it) could be sold to an institutional investor for private rental. The discount to individual sale value is typically ten to fifteen percent, but the certainty and speed of a bulk sale can be attractive when the alternative is months of uncertain retail sales. We can introduce developers to institutional purchasers who are actively acquiring residential stock for their rental portfolios.",

By refinancing the development facility onto a longer-term product with lower monthly costs, the developer can afford to take a more patient approach to sales without the constant pressure of an approaching maturity date.

Developers who insist that their GDV assumptions remain valid despite clear evidence of market softening, or who present unrealistic sales timelines based on pre-downturn market conditions, quickly lose credibility with their lender. A more effective approach is to acknowledge the market reality, present a revised appraisal based on current evidence, and demonstrate that the project still generates a positive outcome (even if the profit margin has been reduced from twenty percent to ten percent). Lenders would far rather see a realistic assessment than an optimistic fantasy.",
          "If the market downturn is causing stress across your lender's portfolio (as opposed to affecting just your development), be aware that the lender may have limited capacity to accommodate multiple troubled facilities simultaneously. Some lenders respond to portfolio stress by accelerating enforcement on their weaker facilities to recover capital and improve their overall position. Understanding your lender's portfolio stress level can help you assess the likelihood of accommodation — though this information is not always readily available. Your broker can often provide insight into the lender's current appetite for workout and restructuring based on their ongoing relationship.",

Restructuring options include: extending the facility term (with appropriate fee and interest adjustments), converting some or all of the development into rental stock and refinancing onto a <a href=\"/services#commercial-mortgages\">commercial mortgage</a> or investment facility, bringing in a JV partner who contributes additional equity in exchange for a share of the eventual profits, or negotiating a consensual sale of the development at current market value with the lender accepting a shortfall on the debt (which typically also involves negotiation of the personal guarantee liability).",
          "Converting to rental is an increasingly viable strategy, particularly for developments in areas with strong rental demand. The rental market often remains robust during periods of sales market weakness, as buyers who cannot or choose not to purchase become tenants instead. Converting to rental requires a different financial product — a buy-to-let mortgage or commercial investment facility — which typically offers longer terms (up to twenty-five years), lower interest rates (four to seven percent per annum), and interest-only payment options. The key requirement is that the rental income must cover the interest payments with an adequate margin (typically a minimum of 125% income cover).",
          "A JV equity injection can be an effective strategy where the developer lacks the financial resources to support the project through a prolonged downturn but the project has genuine long-term value. The JV partner contributes cash equity in exchange for a share of the eventual profits (or a share of the equity in the development). This additional equity can reduce the facility balance, cure covenant breaches, and provide working capital for the extended sales period. We can introduce developers to equity partners who specialise in investing in distressed but viable development projects.",

This avoids the costs and stigma of enforcement proceedings and allows the developer to negotiate the treatment of any shortfall and personal guarantee liability in a structured manner. While surrendering a development is never the preferred outcome, it may preserve the developer's ability to continue operating and developing future projects — whereas a contested enforcement and bankruptcy can end a development career entirely.

        content: [
          "Loan-to-value (LTV) covenants are among the most common financial covenants in <a href=\"/services#development-finance\">development finance</a> facility agreements. An LTV covenant requires the outstanding loan balance to remain below a specified percentage of the current market value of the secured property. Typical LTV covenants in development finance range from sixty-five to seventy-five percent, depending on the lender, the property type, and the stage of construction. A facility with a seventy percent LTV covenant and an outstanding balance of £2,100,000 requires the property to maintain a minimum value of £3,000,000.",
          "LTV covenants are tested at regular intervals throughout the facility term — typically quarterly, although some facilities test LTV at every monitoring surveyor visit. The value used for covenant testing may be the original valuation, a desktop revaluation, or a full RICS revaluation, depending on the facility agreement. Some agreements provide that the lender can require a full revaluation at any time, while others specify that revaluations occur only at defined intervals. The precise mechanics of how and when LTV is tested should be understood clearly at the outset of the facility.",
          "It is important to distinguish between the different types of LTV covenant that may appear in a development finance facility. The most common is loan-to-current market value (LTV), which measures the debt against the property's value in its current state (which for a development under construction is typically the land value plus the value of works completed to date). Some facilities also include a loan-to-gross development value (LTGDV) covenant, which measures the debt against the projected value of the completed development. A fall in projected GDV — due to market softening or a downward revaluation — can trigger an LTGDV breach even if the current market value has not changed.",

      {
        heading: "Common triggers for LTV covenant breaches",
        content: [
          "The most common trigger for an LTV covenant breach is a decline in property values. If the property market softens — whether nationally or in the specific micro-location of the development — the value of the security falls while the outstanding loan balance remains the same (or increases, due to capitalised interest and additional drawdowns). This mechanical effect can push the LTV ratio above the covenant threshold without any deterioration in the quality of the development or the competence of the developer.",
          "A second common trigger is a downward revaluation by the monitoring surveyor. The monitoring surveyor provides an assessment of the development's value at each site visit, and if they take a more conservative view of achievable sales prices or apply a higher discount for the partially completed state of the building, the assessed value may be lower than expected. Monitoring surveyors are required to exercise independent professional judgment, and they will reflect current market conditions in their assessment. If comparable evidence suggests that values have softened, the monitoring surveyor will adjust their figures accordingly.",
          "A third trigger relates to the capitalisation of interest. In development finance, interest is typically rolled up (added to the loan balance) rather than paid monthly. This means the outstanding loan balance increases over time, even if no additional drawdowns are made. On a £2,500,000 facility at nine percent per annum, the loan balance increases by approximately £18,750 per month through interest capitalisation alone. Over an eighteen-month build programme, this adds approximately £337,500 to the outstanding balance, pushing the effective LTV higher. Developers should account for interest capitalisation when assessing their covenant headroom at each stage of the project.",
          "Cost overruns that require additional drawdowns can also trigger LTV breaches. If the approved build budget is exceeded and the lender agrees to increase the facility to fund the overrun, the additional drawdown increases the loan balance and may push the LTV above the covenant threshold. Even where the lender approves the additional advance, the covenant breach must still be addressed — the lender may waive the breach as part of the facility increase agreement, but this is not automatic and should be confirmed in writing. For a detailed discussion of cost overrun management, see our guide on <a href=\"/guides/cost-overruns-development-finance\">cost overruns and development finance</a>.",

        content: [
          "An LTV covenant breach constitutes a default event under the facility agreement. Once a default event has occurred, the lender has the right (but not the obligation) to exercise a range of remedies, including: demanding immediate repayment of the facility (acceleration), refusing to make further drawdowns, charging default interest on the outstanding balance, and ultimately enforcing its security by appointing an LPA receiver or exercising its power of sale.",
          "In practice, the lender's response to an LTV breach depends on several factors: the severity of the breach (a breach of one to two percentage points is treated very differently from a breach of ten percentage points), the cause of the breach (market-driven breaches may attract more sympathy than breaches caused by project-specific issues), the developer's track record and relationship with the lender, and the overall viability of the project. A marginal LTV breach on an otherwise well-performing project is unlikely to trigger enforcement, while a significant breach on a troubled project may accelerate the lender's decision to enforce.",
          "The immediate practical consequences of an LTV breach typically include: the suspension of further drawdowns (until the breach is cured or waived), the commencement of default interest (typically two to four percentage points above the facility rate), enhanced monitoring requirements (additional site visits, more frequent reporting), and the requirement for the borrower to present a remediation plan. These consequences are significant even if enforcement does not follow immediately, because the suspension of drawdowns can stall construction and the accrual of default interest increases the facility cost substantially.",
          "For a £3,000,000 facility, default interest at three percent above the standard rate adds approximately £7,500 per month to the interest bill. Over a three-month period while the breach is being addressed, this amounts to £22,500 in additional costs — which further erodes the project's profitability and may exacerbate the covenant breach. This self-reinforcing cycle is one of the most dangerous aspects of LTV covenant breaches, and it underscores the importance of addressing the breach as quickly as possible.",

          "The most direct way to cure an LTV covenant breach is to reduce the loan balance to a level that restores the LTV ratio below the covenant threshold. This is achieved by making a partial repayment (sometimes called a cash cure or equity top-up). For example, if the LTV covenant is seventy percent, the current value is £3,000,000, and the outstanding balance is £2,200,000 (giving an LTV of seventy-three percent), a repayment of approximately £100,000 would reduce the balance to £2,100,000 and restore the LTV to seventy percent.",
          "If the developer does not have £100,000 of available cash, alternative sources of equity include: releasing funds from other investments or deposits, arranging a short-term <a href=\"/services#bridging-loans\">bridging loan</a> against other property assets, bringing in a co-investor who contributes equity in exchange for a profit share, or negotiating with the lender for an alternative remedy such as additional security over other assets. Each option has costs and implications that should be evaluated carefully with your broker and solicitor.",
          "Another strategy is to challenge the valuation that triggered the breach. If you believe the monitoring surveyor's assessment is overly conservative, you can instruct your own RICS surveyor to provide an independent valuation and present this to the lender as evidence that the covenant has not, in fact, been breached. The success of this approach depends on the quality of the comparable evidence and the credibility of the independent valuer. If the independent valuation is materially higher than the monitoring surveyor's assessment, the lender may commission a further independent valuation to resolve the discrepancy.",
          "If the breach cannot be cured through partial repayment or valuation challenge, the developer should seek a formal covenant waiver from the lender. As discussed in our guide on <a href=\"/guides/breach-of-covenant-development-loans\">breach of covenant on development loans</a>, a waiver is a formal agreement by the lender to overlook the breach, usually for a specified period and subject to conditions. The waiver may require the developer to take specific actions (such as accelerating the sales programme or reducing asking prices) and will usually involve a waiver fee of £2,500 to £10,000.",

        content: [
          "Prevention is always preferable to remediation. The most effective way to prevent LTV covenant breaches is to structure the facility with adequate covenant headroom from the outset. If the maximum LTV available from the lender is seventy percent, consider whether a facility at sixty to sixty-five percent LTV provides a more comfortable margin of safety. The additional equity required is a form of insurance against market fluctuations, and the cost of providing slightly more equity is minimal compared to the cost of dealing with a covenant breach.",
          "Monitor your covenant position regularly — at least monthly — rather than waiting for the monitoring surveyor's quarterly report. Calculate the LTV ratio using current comparable evidence and the current drawn balance (including capitalised interest), and track the trend over time. If the ratio is moving towards the covenant threshold, take action before it breaches — this might mean accelerating sales, making a voluntary partial repayment, or approaching the lender for a pre-emptive covenant amendment.",
          "Consider negotiating covenant mechanics that provide flexibility. For example, some facilities define LTV by reference to the higher of the current market value and the original valuation — meaning that a temporary market dip does not trigger a breach if values subsequently recover. Others include a materiality threshold (for example, the covenant is only tested if the breach exceeds two percentage points), or a cure period that gives the borrower time to remedy a breach before it becomes a formal default event. These provisions are negotiable at the outset of the facility, and an experienced broker can help you secure more favourable covenant terms.",
          "Finally, choose your lender carefully. Some development finance lenders take a rigid approach to covenant testing and enforcement, while others adopt a more pragmatic and relationship-based approach. A lender who has a track record of working constructively with borrowers during market fluctuations is a more appropriate partner for a development than one who enforces mechanically at the first sign of a covenant breach.

          "While LTV and LTGDV covenants are related concepts, they behave differently during market downturns and at different stages of the construction programme. An LTV covenant measured against current market value will typically tighten as the development progresses, because the drawn balance increases (through additional drawdowns and capitalised interest) while the current market value of a partially completed building may not increase at the same rate. An LTGDV covenant, by contrast, may remain stable during construction if the projected GDV is unchanged, but can deteriorate sharply if a revaluation reduces the GDV projection.",
          "The interaction between LTV and LTGDV covenants can create situations where one covenant is comfortably within threshold while the other is breached. For example, a development that is eighty percent complete may have a current market value close to the GDV (because most of the construction risk has been eliminated), meaning the LTV covenant is comfortable. However, if the projected GDV has been reduced due to market softening, the LTGDV covenant may be breached. Developers must monitor both covenants independently and understand which is most likely to be the binding constraint at each stage of the project.",
          "Some facility agreements contain only one of these covenants, while others contain both. Where both are present, the binding covenant is the one that creates the tightest constraint at any given time. In our experience, LTGDV covenants are more common in development finance than pure LTV covenants, because LTGDV better reflects the lender's economic exposure on a development project. However, some lenders use current market value LTV as an additional backstop, particularly for larger facilities or more complex developments.",
          "When negotiating your facility, understand which covenants are included, how they are tested, and what the practical implications are at different stages of the build. If your facility contains both LTV and LTGDV covenants, request a sensitivity analysis from your broker showing how each covenant performs under different value scenarios. This analysis should be updated monthly during the build to give you early warning of potential covenant pressure. We provide this analysis as standard for all facilities we arrange — it is one of the most valuable risk management tools available to developers managing financed projects.",

The situations most likely to result in enforcement are: a significant breach (ten or more percentage points above the covenant threshold) combined with a deteriorating project, a breach that the borrower cannot cure because they lack the financial resources to inject additional equity, a repeated pattern of covenant breaches suggesting the project is fundamentally unviable at current values, or a breakdown in the relationship between borrower and lender that makes constructive negotiation impossible.",
          "If enforcement appears likely, the developer should take immediate steps to protect their position. This includes: seeking specialist legal advice on the enforcement process and the developer's rights, exploring urgent refinancing options with alternative lenders (see our guide on <a href=\"/guides/refinancing-distressed-development\">refinancing a distressed development</a>), assessing the personal guarantee exposure and taking advice on managing this liability, and considering whether a consensual resolution (such as a voluntary sale or surrender) might achieve a better outcome than contested enforcement.",

In the most benign cases, the lender grants repeated waivers and the breach is eventually resolved through sales proceeds reducing the facility balance.

The triggers for restructuring are varied: cost overruns that have exhausted the approved budget, programme delays that push the project past the facility's maturity date, market softening that reduces the projected GDV below the level needed to repay the debt, or a combination of these factors. In each case, the existing facility terms no longer align with the project's realistic trajectory, and new terms must be negotiated to give the project a viable path to completion.",
          "Restructuring is fundamentally different from default and enforcement. Where default leads to the lender exercising its rights to recover its debt, restructuring involves a consensual modification of the facility terms to reflect changed circumstances. The lender agrees to adjust the terms because it believes the restructured facility offers a better recovery prospect than enforcement. The developer retains control of the project and continues to manage it towards completion and exit. This mutual benefit is what makes restructuring possible — and why it should be pursued energetically by any developer whose project is under stress.",
          "In our experience, the window for effective restructuring opens when problems are first identified and closes when the lender loses confidence in the borrower's ability to manage the project. Once the lender has decided to enforce, restructuring becomes extremely difficult — the lender's legal and credit teams have committed to an enforcement strategy, and reversing that decision requires compelling evidence that the project can still deliver a satisfactory outcome under the borrower's management.

Term extensions are appropriate where the project is fundamentally sound but the programme or sales timeline has slipped beyond the original maturity date. The extension may be accompanied by a modest increase in the interest rate (typically 0.5% to 1.5% per annum above the original rate) and an extension fee (typically 0.25% to 1% of the outstanding balance per month of extension). On a £2,800,000 facility, a three-month extension at 0.5% per month plus a 1% interest rate increase adds approximately £42,000 in extension fees and £7,000 per month in additional interest — a significant but manageable cost.",
          "A facility increase involves the lender advancing additional funds to cover cost overruns or unexpected expenses. This is appropriate where the development remains viable at the revised cost level and the developer has contributed additional equity to share the burden. The facility increase may be structured as an additional tranche within the existing facility or as a separate supplementary facility. The terms of the additional advance are typically more expensive than the original facility, reflecting the increased risk.",
          "A covenant reset involves amending the financial covenants to reflect the project's revised parameters. If falling values have pushed the LTGDV above the covenant threshold, the lender may agree to increase the covenant level from (for example) sixty-five percent to seventy percent, provided the project still demonstrates adequate profitability at the revised GDV. Covenant resets are usually accompanied by enhanced monitoring requirements and may require the developer to provide additional security.",

The developer must present the lender with a compelling case that the project has a viable future under restructured terms, and that the restructured outcome offers a better recovery for the lender than the alternative of enforcement. This case must be supported by detailed financial analysis, current market evidence, and a credible revised plan for completion and exit.",
          "The core document for any restructuring negotiation is a revised development appraisal that honestly reflects the project's current position. This appraisal should show: the total expenditure to date (including all costs, fees, and capitalised interest), the cost to complete (based on current contractor quotes or QS estimates), the projected GDV (based on current comparable evidence, not the original assumptions), the projected profit on both an absolute and percentage basis, and a sensitivity analysis showing how the project performs under different GDV and cost scenarios. The appraisal must be realistic — lenders see through optimistic projections and will lose confidence in a developer who presents unrealistic numbers.",
          "The second key document is a revised programme showing the anticipated completion date and exit timeline, with supporting evidence from the contractor or project manager. The third is an updated sales or exit strategy, supported by current market evidence — agent appraisals, comparable transaction data, and (where available) evidence of buyer interest such as viewings, offers, or reservations.",
          "Before entering negotiations, assess the lender's likely position and identify the key concessions you need. Prioritise your requests — for example, a term extension may be more important than a reduction in default interest. Understand what the lender is likely to demand in return — additional equity, additional security, enhanced reporting, or a higher interest rate. Having this analysis prepared in advance allows you to negotiate from a position of informed flexibility rather than reactive desperation. <a href=\"/deal-room\">Contact our deal room</a> to discuss your restructuring strategy — we bring significant experience to these negotiations and can often achieve outcomes that developers would struggle to achieve independently.",

        content: [
          "The most effective negotiation strategy is to present the restructuring as a commercially rational decision for the lender, not an act of mercy towards the borrower. Frame every proposal in terms of the lender's recovery: \"A three-month extension at revised terms gives you a projected recovery of one hundred percent of principal plus £150,000 in additional fees and interest, compared to a receivership that our analysis suggests would recover ninety-two percent of principal after costs.\" Lenders are commercial entities, and they respond to commercial arguments.",
          "Bring something to the table. A restructuring proposal that asks the lender to make all the concessions while the developer contributes nothing additional is unlikely to succeed. The developer should be prepared to offer one or more of: additional equity injection, additional security (such as a second charge over personal property or other development assets), an increased interest rate, an enhanced personal guarantee (or a new guarantee from a third party), and a commitment to accelerated sales activity (including reduced asking prices if appropriate).",
          "Use your broker as a negotiating intermediary. We understand the lender's internal processes, their credit team's decision-making framework, and the commercial pressures they face. We can frame proposals in language the lender understands, anticipate objections, and propose solutions that address the lender's concerns while protecting the developer's interests. Many of the most successful restructurings we have arranged were achieved through multiple rounds of negotiation, each refining the proposal until both parties were comfortable with the revised terms.",
          "Be prepared for the negotiation to take time. Unlike initial facility arrangements, which can complete in two to four weeks, restructuring negotiations often take four to eight weeks because the lender's credit team must approve the revised terms, the legal documentation must be amended, and additional conditions may need to be satisfied. During this period, continue managing the project diligently — demonstrating that you are progressing the build, managing costs, and advancing the exit strategy. A developer who is seen to be actively managing the project during restructuring negotiations reinforces the lender's confidence in the restructured outcome.",

        heading: "The role of specialist advisors in restructuring",
        content: [
          "Restructuring a development loan is a specialist skill that benefits significantly from professional advice. The key advisors are: a development finance broker with restructuring experience (who manages the lender relationship and prepares the restructuring proposal), a solicitor with experience in facility amendments and default management (who negotiates the legal documentation), and potentially a quantity surveyor (who provides an independent cost-to-complete assessment) and a RICS valuer (who provides an independent valuation to support the restructuring case).",
          "The cost of professional advice during a restructuring is typically £15,000 to £40,000, comprising broker fees, legal fees, and QS and valuation costs. This is a significant expense for a developer already under financial pressure, but it is a fraction of the cost of an unsuccessful restructuring (which leads to enforcement) or a poorly negotiated restructuring (which may cost the developer significantly more than necessary in additional fees, interest, and equity). In our experience, professional advice typically saves developers multiples of its cost through better terms, avoided enforcement costs, and preserved equity.",
          "The solicitor's role is particularly important in a restructuring. The revised facility terms must be documented in a formal amendment or supplement to the existing facility agreement, and the terms must be carefully drafted to protect the developer's interests as well as the lender's. Key points to watch for include: the scope of any waiver (does it cover past breaches only, or does it also provide protection against future breaches within a specified range?), the conditions attached to the restructured facility (are they achievable and within the developer's control?), and the treatment of default interest (is the accrued default interest being capitalised into the loan balance, or is it being waived as part of the restructuring?).",
          "In some complex restructuring situations, it may be beneficial to engage a turnaround consultant — a specialist professional who works with the developer to stabilise the project, renegotiate contracts, and implement operational improvements that support the restructured facility. Turnaround consultants are most commonly used on larger developments (with a GDV above £10,000,000) where the operational complexity justifies the additional cost. For smaller developments, the broker and solicitor working together can usually provide the level of advice and support needed to achieve a successful restructuring.",

        heading: "Restructuring with mezzanine debt in the capital stack",
        content: [
          "Restructuring becomes significantly more complex when the capital structure includes both senior and mezzanine debt. Any changes to the senior facility terms must be considered in the context of the <a href=\"/guides/intercreditor-agreements-explained\">intercreditor agreement</a>, and the mezzanine lender's consent may be required for certain amendments. Conversely, if the mezzanine facility also needs to be restructured, the senior lender must agree to any changes that affect its priority position.",
          "Common restructuring scenarios in dual-lender structures include: the senior lender extending its facility term (which may require the mezzanine lender to also extend, or to agree that its facility remains subordinated for the extended period), the senior lender increasing its facility (which requires the mezzanine lender to agree to subordinate to a larger senior debt), the mezzanine lender converting some or all of its debt to equity (which reduces the total debt burden and improves the senior lender's LTV position), and both lenders agreeing to a standstill while the developer implements a revised business plan.",
          "The dynamics of restructuring with two lenders are inherently more complex because the lenders' interests may diverge. The senior lender's priority position means it is more likely to be repaid in full, even in a downturn, so it may be less motivated to agree to concessions. The mezzanine lender, whose recovery depends on the project achieving a higher value, may be more willing to make concessions (such as reducing its interest rate or extending its term) to keep the project alive. The developer must navigate these different motivations and propose a restructuring that gives each lender enough to secure their agreement.",
          "We have significant experience in restructuring dual-lender capital structures and understand the dynamics of intercreditor negotiations. If your development has both senior and mezzanine debt and you are considering a restructuring, <a href=\"/deal-room\">contact our deal room</a> at the earliest opportunity. The earlier we are involved, the more options we can explore and the greater the likelihood of achieving a restructuring that preserves the developer's position.",

          "A successful restructuring is not the end of the process — it is the beginning of a new phase that requires disciplined execution. The restructured facility will typically contain enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements, tighter milestones, and specific conditions that must be met within defined timeframes. Failure to comply with the restructured terms will be treated far more seriously than a first-time breach, because the lender has already demonstrated forbearance and will expect the developer to deliver on their commitments.",
          "Implement a rigorous monitoring framework that tracks compliance with every element of the restructured facility. This includes: financial covenant metrics (LTV, LTGDV, LTC) calculated and recorded monthly, programme milestones tracked weekly, cost expenditure compared to the revised budget weekly, and sales or exit activity reported monthly. Share this information proactively with the lender — do not wait to be asked. Demonstrating that you are on top of the project and delivering against the restructured plan builds confidence and reduces the likelihood of the lender reverting to enforcement.",
          "If the project continues to face challenges after the restructuring — for example, if costs overrun again or sales remain slower than projected — communicate with the lender immediately and propose adjustments. A second restructuring is possible but significantly more difficult to achieve than the first, because the lender's confidence will have been further eroded. The best way to avoid a second restructuring is to implement the first restructuring plan meticulously and deliver the outcomes you committed to.",
          "We stay closely involved with our clients throughout the post-restructuring period, providing ongoing monitoring support, managing lender communications, and advising on any adjustments needed as the project progresses. This continuity of support ensures that the restructured facility remains on track and that any emerging issues are identified and addressed before they become material.
